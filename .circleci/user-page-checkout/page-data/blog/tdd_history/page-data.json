Perlis at the NATO Software Engineering Conferences</h1>\n<p>Alan J. Perlis describes already in 1968 a software development process that has a lot of similarities with TDD.</p>\n<p><em>“1. A software system can best be designed if the testing is interlaced with the designing instead of being used after the design.</em>\n<em>2. A simulation which matches the requirements contains the control which organizes the design of the system.</em>\n<em>3. Through successive repetitions of this process of interlaced testing and design the model ultimately becomes the software system itself. I think that it is the key of the approach that has been suggested, that there is no such question as testing things after the fact with simulation models, but that in effect the testing and the replacement of simulations with modules that are deeper and more detailed goes on with the simulation model controlling, as it were, the place and order in which these things are done.”</em></p>\n<p>Alan J.

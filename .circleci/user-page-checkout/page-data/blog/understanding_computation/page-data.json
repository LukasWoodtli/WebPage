A successful execution of a program’s static semantics doesn’t mean “this program will definitely work,” only “this program definitely won’t fail in a particular way” It would be great to have an automated system that can tell us that a program is free of any conceivable kind of bug or error, but as we saw […], the universe just isn’t that convenient.”</em> - page 338</p>\n<p><em>“Formally, abstract interpretation is a mathematical technique where different semantics for the same language are connected together by functions that convert collections of concrete values into abstract ones and vice versa, allowing the results and properties of abstract programs to be understood in terms of concrete ones.”</em> - page 338</p>\n<p><em>“Java has a <strong>type and effect system</strong> that tracks not only the types of methods’ arguments and return values but also which <strong>checked exceptions</strong> can be thrown by the body of the method (throwing an exception is an <strong>effect</strong>), which is used to ensure that all possible exceptions are either handled or explicitly propagated.”</em> - page 339</p>\n<h1 id=\"afterword\">Afterword</h1>\n<p><em>“Every computer program is a mathematical object. Syntactically a program is just a large number; semantically it can represent a mathematical function, or a hierarchical structure which can be manipulated by formal reduction rules.

It’s tempting to think of computation as a sophisticated human invention that can only be performed by specially-designed systems with many complicated parts, but it also shows up in systems that don’t seem complex enough to support it. So computation isn’t a sterile, artificial process that only happens inside a microprocessor, but rather a pervasive phenomenon that crops up in many different places and in many different ways.”</em> - page 341</p>\n<p><em>“Computation is not all-or-nothing.

This is called a screw motion. The concept of screw can be applied to motion (twist) or to forces and momentum (wrench).</p>\n<h1 id=\"twist\">Twist</h1>\n<p>The instantaneous spatial velocity of a rigid body in terms of its linear and angular components is called a twist.\nIt can be represented as a point in <span class=\"math math-inline\"><span class=\"katex\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi mathvariant=\"double-struck\">R</mi><mn>6</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\mathbb{R}^6</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, defined by 3 angular and 3 linear velocities.\nA twist can be seen as an infinitesimal screw motion.</p>\n<p>Any configuration of a rigid-body can be achieved by starting from a fixed point (reference frame) and integrating a <em>constant twist</em> for a specified time (Exponential Coordinates). Such a motion resembles the motion of a screw, rotating about and translating along the same fixed axis.</p>\n<h1 id=\"wrench\">Wrench</h1>\n<p>A system of forces acting on a rigid body can be replaced by a single force along a line and a torque about that line. These forces are referred to as wrench. Many theorems that apply to twists can be extended to wrenches.</p>\n<p>Similar to angular and linear velocities are packed into a vector in <span class=\"math math-inline\"><span class=\"katex\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi mathvariant=\"double-struck\">R</mi><mn>6</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\mathbb{R}^6</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> (twist), moments (torques) and forces are packed together into a vector in <span class=\"math math-inline\"><span class=\"katex\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi mathvariant=\"double-struck\">R</mi><mn>6</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\mathbb{R}^6</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> called <em>wrench</em> (<em>spacial forces</em>).</p>\n<h1 id=\"literature\">Literature</h1>\n<p>Notes taken from:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hades.mech.northwestern.edu/index.php/Modern_Robotics\">Modern Robotics: Mechanics, Planning, and Control</a> by Kevin M.

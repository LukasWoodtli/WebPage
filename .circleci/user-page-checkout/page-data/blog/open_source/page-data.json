I’m very exited how many projects are around and widely used and supported. But I also observe the fear of companies with a more traditional background to touch anything that has to do with open source let alone to put some of their work into the public.</p>\n<h1 id=\"open-source-or-free-software-or-beer-or-speech-or-gratis-or-\">Open Source or Free Software or Beer or Speech or Gratis or …</h1>\n<p>All this different expressions for the same concepts are just confusing. And arguing about them doesn’t help to make the idea behind this buzzwords\nto get a broader acceptance.</p>\n<h1 id=\"permissive-copy-leftright\">Permissive Copy Left/Right</h1>\n<p>There are a lot of confusing different license strategies. If a new project is started it’s important choose (or define an new) license carefully. It not only gives the initiator of the project the legal security, but it is also a statement to the public.</p>\n<p>Companies might consider to use open source with a permissive license than an copy left one since they don’t need to publish the source code of their product.\nThey might even do some improvements that then get’s back to the community. And it could even happen that they consider to give the comunity something back and release some library or tool to the public.</p>\n<p>Companies should release at least some libraries or frameworks as open source. They might get improvements from the community. And if the architecture is usable for other projects it means it’s flexible, extensible and decoupled from other code.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Open Source Software","tags":null,"category":"Programming"},"headings":[{"depth":1,"value":"Open Source, Free Software, Proprietary and Companies interests"},{"depth":1,"value":"Open Source or Free Software or Beer or Speech or Gratis or …"},{"depth":1,"value":"Permissive Copy Left/Right"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"76e85345-e38b-5281-973d-93f8d49ac2df","previousPost":{"title":"Cosine Distance","slug":"/blog/cosine_distance"},"nextPost":{"title":"SystemC","slug":"/blog/systemc"},"dates":{"created":1453238812,"modified":1647509701}}},

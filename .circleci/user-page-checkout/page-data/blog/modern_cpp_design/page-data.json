Smart pointers, however, are not the best place to implement COW, because smart pointers cannot differentiate between calls to const and non- const member functions of the pointee object.”</em></p>\n<p><em>“Function invocations for the pointee object happen somewhere beyond the reach of the smart pointer.”</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"reference-counting\">Reference Counting</h3>\n<p><em>“You should not keep dumb pointers and smart pointers to the same object.”</em></p>\n<p><em>“The actual counter must be shared among smart pointer objects”</em></p>\n<p><em>“Reference management - be it counting or linking - is a victim of the resource leak known as <strong>cyclic reference</strong>.”</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"destructive-copy\">Destructive Copy</h3>\n<p><em>“C++ etiquette calls for the right-hand side of the copy constructor and the assignment operator to be a reference to a <code class=\"language-text\">const</code> object.

Because etiquette exists for a reason, you should expect negative consequences if you break it.”</em></p>\n<p><em>“Because they do not support value semantics, smart pointers with destructive copy cannot be stored in standard containers and in general must be handled with almost as much care as raw pointers.”</em></p>\n<p><em>“On the bright side, smart pointers with destructive copy have significant advantages:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>They incur almost no overhead.</em></li>\n<li><em>They are good at enforcing ownership transfer semantics.</em></li>\n<li><em>They are good as return values from functions.</em></li>\n<li><em>They are excellent as stack variables in functions that have multiple return paths.</em>”</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"the-address-of-operator\">The Address-of Operator</h3>\n<p><em>“There are two reasons why overloading unary <code class=\"language-text\">operator&amp;</code> is not a very good idea. One reason is that exposing the address of the pointed-to object implies giving up any automatic ownership management. […] The second reason, a more pragmatic one, is that overloading unary <code class=\"language-text\">operator&amp;</code> makes the smart pointer unusable with STL containers. Actually, overloading unary <code class=\"language-text\">operator&amp;</code> for a type pretty much makes generic programming impossible for that type, because the address of an object is too fundamental a property to play with naively. Most generic code assumes that applying <code class=\"language-text\">&amp;</code> to an object of type <code class=\"language-text\">T</code> returns an object of type <code class=\"language-text\">T*</code> […] address-of is a fundamental concept. If you defy this concept, generic code behaves strangely either at compile time or - worse - at runtime.”</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"putting-it-all-together\">Putting It All Together</h3>\n<p><em>“A rule for all policies is that they must have value semantics; that is, they must define a proper copy constructor and assignment operator.”</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"object-factories\">Object Factories</h2>\n<p><em>”[…] subject to the paradox of ‘virtual constructors’. You need virtual constructors when the information about the object to be created is inherently dynamic and cannot be used directly with C++ constructs.”</em></p>\n<p><em>“This marks a fundamental difference between creating objects and invoking virtual member functions in C++. Virtual member functions are fluid, dynamic - you can change their behavior without changing the call site. In contrast, each object creation is a stumbling block of statically bound, rigid code.”</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"the-need-for-object-factories\">The Need for Object Factories</h3>\n<p><em>”[…] an object factory may be needed. When you save an object to a file, you must save its actual type in the form of a string, an integral value, an identifier of some sort. Thus, although the type information exists, its <strong>form</strong> does not allow you to create C++ objects.”</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"object-factories-in-c-classes-and-objects\">Object Factories in C++: Classes and Objects</h3>\n<p><em>“In C++, classes and objects are different beasts. Classes are what the programmer creates, and objects are what the program creates. You cannot create a new class at runtime, and you cannot create an object at compile time. Classes don’t have first-class status: You cannot copy a class, store it in a variable, or return it from a function.”</em></p>\n<p><em>“In C++ there is a fracture between types and values: A value has a type attribute, but a type cannot exist on its own. If you want to create an object in a totally dynamic way, you need a means to express and pass around a ‘pure’ type and build a value from it on demand. Because you cannot do this, you somehow must represent types as objects - integers, strings, and so on. Then, you must employ some trick to exchange the value for the right type, and finally to use that type to create an object.”</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"abstract-factory\">Abstract Factory</h2>\n<p><em>“However, the more you reduce dependencies, the more you also reduce type knowledge, and consequently the more you undermine the type safety of your design. This is yet another instance of the classic dilemma of better type safety versus lesser dependencies that often appears in C++”</em></p>\n<p><em>”<code class=\"language-text\">Type2Type</code> is a simple template whose unique purpose is to disambiguate overloaded functions.”</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"visitor\">Visitor</h2>\n<p><em>“Visitor gives you a surprising amount of flexibility in a certain area: You can add virtual functions to a class hierarchy without recompiling them or their existing clients. However, this flexibility comes at the expense of disabling features that designers take for granted: You cannot add a new leaf class to the hierarchy without recompiling the hierarchy and all its clients.”</em></p>\n<p><em>“Visitor’s operational area is limited to very stable hierarchies (you seldom add new classes) and heavy processing needs (you often add new virtual functions).”</em></p>\n<p><em>“Visitor goes against programmers’ intuition; therefore, a careful implementation and rigorous discipline are essential to using it successfully.”</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"visitor-basics\">Visitor Basics</h3>\n<p><em>“In a nutshell, from a dependency standpoint, new classes are easy to add, and new virtual member functions are difficult to add.”</em></p>\n<p><em>“Visitor applies best when operations on objects are distinct and unrelated.”</em></p>\n<p><em>“A <strong>type switch</strong> occurs whenever you query a polymorphic object on its concrete type and perform different operations with it depending on what that concrete type is.”</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"back-to-the-cyclic-visitor\">Back to the “Cyclic” Visitor</h3>\n<p><em>“If you use <code class=\"language-text\">dynamic_cast</code> against some object, the runtime support has quite a few things to do.

One reasonable solution is to assign a unique integral identifier to each type in the program. The integral identifier also comes in handy when it comes to exception handling, so it’s quite a wise integrating solution. Then in each class’s virtual table, the compiler puts (a pointer to) a table of identifiers of all its subtypes. Together with these identifiers, the compiler has to store the offsets of the relative positions of the subobjects within the big object. This would be enough information to perform a dynamic cast correctly.”</em></p>\n<p><em>“Details - such as multiple inheritance - render the dynamic cast code even more complicated and slower.”</em></p>\n<p><em>”<code class=\"language-text\">dynamic_cast</code> does have a cost, which is unpredictable and can become unacceptable for some particular needs of an application.”</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"summary-1\">Summary</h3>\n<p><em>“Essentially, Visitor allows you to add virtual functions to a class hierarchy without modifying the classes in that hierarchy.

The multimethods feature allows dispatching of a function call depending on the types of <strong>multiple</strong> objects.

But I’m always open for new interesting challenges.</p>\n<p>There are some requirements that a new position has to meet to catch my attention:</p>\n<h2 id=\"musts\">Musts:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Embedded Software: I prefer Firmware development over programming of PC or server applications. It doesn’t have to be only Embedded Software development but it needs to be part of the job.</li>\n<li>C/C++: I like C but C++ is even better. There must be at least some C++ development involved.</li>\n<li>Working site in Zürich or near (max. 30 minutes by bike): I just don’t like to lose too much time commuting.</li>\n<li>Possibility to work part time (80%): This is an absolute must. I have a family that I need and want to take care of.</li>\n<li>Possibility to work from home occasionally (home office): Sometimes it’s just convenient to work from home.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"mustnt\">Mustn’t:</h2>\n<!-- - no .NET (C#, Visual Basic, F#): I just don't like it! I won't take any job that contains .NET development! -->\n<!-- - no Windows centric development: It's just not as nice and powerful as UNIX/Linux and it lacks a lot of important tools. -->\n<ul>\n<li>I’ll never work for the weapons industry: I don’t like wars!</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"nice-to-have\">Nice to have</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Possibility to make sport (jogging in the neighbourhood, showers)</li>\n<li>Team leading position</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- https://wuputah.com/2010/08/07/a-note-to-recruiters-->","frontmatter":{"title":"Note to Recruiters and Headhunters"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"add522f2-99fd-5803-bd31-3d5a571bd0de"}},

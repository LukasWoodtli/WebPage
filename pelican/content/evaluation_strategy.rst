Applicative order evaluation (eager evaluation)
===============================================
All arguments to procedures are evaluated when provided to procedure (when procedure is applied)

- for example *Scheme* uses this evaluation strategy

Normal order evaluation (lazy evaluation)
=========================================
Delay the evaluation of procedure arguments until they are needed

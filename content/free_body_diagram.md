title: Free-Body Diagram
category: Mechanics

The goal of a Free-Body diagram is to identify all the forces acting on an object and then to draw a diagram for that system.

- Divide the problem into object (system) and environment (everything else)
- Draw a sketch of the object and everything that is in contact with the object
- Find points where contact forces may act (contact points)
- Draw the forces as arrows (vectors) starting at contact points
  - All forces need to have a identifiable cause in the environment
  - Draw the vectors in positive direction of the force
  - Try to make the length of the arrow (vector) relative to the magnitude of the force
  - Name all the forces
  - Forces are either contact forces or long-range forces
- Draw the axes of the coordinate system
  - It is often convenient to make one axis pointing in the direction of motion

# Joints

Every joint connects *exactly* two links.

A joint:

- provides freedoms to allow one rigid body to move relative to another.
- provides constraints on the possible motions of the two rigid bodies it connects.

$dof\ (of\ joint) = dof\ (of\ rigid\ body) - number\ of\ constraints\ (of\ joint)$


## Typical Joints

| Joint type                                                                | dof ($f$) | Constraints $c$ in 2D | Constraints $c$ in 3D |

# Configuration Space

Configuration: a specification of the positions of all points of the robot.

Configuration space (C-space):

- The space of all configurations.
- The n-dimensional space containing all possible configurations of the robot.

The configuration of a robot is represented by a point in its C-space.


# Degrees of Freedom (dof)

Degrees of freedom: smallest number of *real-valued* coordinates needed to represent its configuration.
It's the dimension of the C-space or minimum number of real-valued numbers needed to represent the configuration.


$$dof = (sum\ of\ freedoms\ of\ the\ bodies) - (number\ of\ independent\ constraints)$$

Degree of freedom depends on:

- Number of links
- Number of joints
- Types of joints
- Distribution of joints within mechanism

It does not depend on length of links.




## Rigid body (number of degrees of freedom)

- 2D (planar bodies): 3
- 3D (spatial bodies): 6


## Degrees of freedom in 3D:

- x
- y
- z
- roll
- pitch
- yaw



# Gr√ºbler's Formula

- $N$: Number of links (ground is also a link)
- $J$: Number of joints
- $m$: Degrees of freedom of rigid body (3 in 2D, 6 in 3D)
- $f_i$: Number of freedoms of joint $i$
- $c_i$: Number of constraints of joint $i$
- where $\forall i;f_i + c_i = m$


$$\begin{align*}
dof &= \underbrace{m(N-1)}_{rigid\ body \ freedoms} - \underbrace{\sum_{i=1}^Jc_i}_{joint\ constraints}\\ 
 &= m(N-1)-\sum_{i=1}^J(m-f_i)\\ 
 &= m(N-1-J)+\sum_{i=1}^Jf_i
\end{align*}$$

The formula holds only if all constraints for the joints are independent.

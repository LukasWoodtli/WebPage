# Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI)

serial, full-duplex
master-slave (one master, multiple slaves)
4 wires:
* SCLK: Serial Clock (output from master)
* MOSI: Master Out Slave In (data output from master)
* MISO: Master In Slave Out (data output from slave)
* CS /SS: Chip/Slave Select (often active-low, output from master to activate communication on device)
Clock frequency: few MHz

Word size usually 8 bit

Topology:
independent slaves (parallel)
daisy chain

Throughput:
up to 60 Mbps (over short distances), depending on clock speed and electrical characteristics of the connecting wires

Pros/Cons:
Pro:
- Full duplex communication 
- Higher throughput than I2C
- Slaves donâ€™t need own clock oscillator
- No unique addresses needed

Cons:
- More pins/wires than I2C
- No control flow, acknowledge of received messages and error checking
- Only for relative short distances (compared to RS-232, RS-485, or CAN-bus)
- variations between vendors can lead to difficulties


Uses:
* temperature and pressure sensors, touchscreen, LCD
* ADC/DAC, digital potentiometers
* Communications devices: Ethernet, WiFi, USB, UART, CAN, ZigBee
* flash and EEPROM
* Real-time clocks
* SD and MMC cards


# I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)

serial, half-duplex

SMBus is a subset of I2C.

2 wires:
- data
- clock


Bitrate:

0.1-5.0 Mbit/s

Title: Note to Recruiters and Headhunters

If you are a recruiter (headhunter) and are looking to hire me, please read this page before [contacting me]({filename}/pages/contact.md).

I'm currently *not* looking for a new job. But I'm always open for new interesting challenges.


There are some requirements that a new position has to meet to catch my attention:


## Musts:

- Embedded Software: I prefer Firmware development to programming of PC or server applications.
- C/C++: I like C but C++ is even better. There must be at least some C++ development involved.
- Working site in Zürich or near (max. 30 minutes by public transport): I just don't like to lose too much time commuting.
- Possibility to work part time (80%): This is an absolute must. I have a family that I need to take care of.
- Possibility to work from home occasionally (home office): Sometimes it's just convenient to work from home.


## Mustn't:

- no .NET (C#, Visual Basic, F#): I just don't like it! I won't take any job that contains .NET development!
- no Windows centric development: It's just not as nice and powerful as UNIX/Linux and it lacks a lot of important tools.
- I'll never work for the weapons industry: I don't like wars!


## Nice to have

- Possibility to make sport (jogging in the neighbourhood, showers)
- Team leading position

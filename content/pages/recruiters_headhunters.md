title: Note to Recruiters and Headhunters
---
If you are a recruiter (headhunter) and are looking to hire me, please read this page before [contacting me](/contact).

I'm currently *not* looking for a new job. But I'm always open for new interesting challenges.

There are some requirements that a new position has to meet to catch my attention:

# Musts:

- Embedded Software: I prefer Firmware development over programming of desktop or server applications. It doesn't have to be Embedded Software development exclusively, but it needs to be part of the job.
- C/C++ and Rust: I like C and C++ but Rust is even better. There must be at least some C++ or Rust development involved.
- Working site in ZÃ¼rich or near (max. 30 minutes by bike): I just don't like to lose too much time commuting.
- Possibility to work part time (80%): This is an absolute must. I have a family that I need and want to take care of.
- Possibility to work from home occasionally (home office): Sometimes it's just convenient to work from home.

# Mustn't:

- I'll never work for the weapons industry (the term 'defence' is an euphemism): I don't like wars!


# Nice to have

- Possibility to make sport (running in the neighbourhood, showers)
- Team leading position

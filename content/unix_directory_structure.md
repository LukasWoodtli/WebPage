# Linux

| `/mnt/`      | Temporary filesystems are mounted here                        |
| `/proc/`     | Virtual file system with live kernel information              |

Any directory ending with `bin/` contains binary executable files (or links to them)

# Procfs

The `/proc` file system is a pseudo filesystem that allows to get informations from the kernel.

The man page can be found with: `man 5 proc`

There are also informations available in the `/sys` file system.



## Processes

Each running process has a subfolder in `/proc` which is named after its PID.

| Directory             | Content                                                                                        |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/proc/$pid/cmdline`  | The command line that was used to start the process.                                           |
| `/proc/$pid/environ`  | The environment of the process.                                                                |
| `/proc/self`          | A link to the current process (can be used prom the process to get information about itself).  |
| `/proc/$pid/fd/`      | A directory that contains references to file descriptors that the process uses.                |
| `/proc/$pid/statm`    | Information about the process memory.                                                          |
| `/proc/$pid/status`   | General formated information: PID, real and effective UID and GID, memory use, bitmasks ...    |
| `/proc/$pid/stat`     | Same as `/proc/$pid/status`. But not formated.                                                 |
| `/proc/$pid/cwd`      | A symbolic link to the current working directory of the process.                               |
| `/proc/$pid/exe`      | A reference to the executable file of the process.                                             |
| `/proc/$pid/root`     | A link to the root directory of the process (s.a. `chroot()`).                                 |
| `/proc/$pid/maps`     | Contains memory mappings to files and libraries used by the process. This file can become very large. |


## Kernel

- The command that was used to run the kernel at boot time can be found with `cat /proc/cmdline`
- More information about kernel parameters can be found with `man bootparam`
- The current locks can be found under `/proc/locks`
- Loaded kernel modules are listed under `/proc/modules`
- Information about filesystems are found under `/proc/filesystems` and `/proc/mounts`


## Hardware

| Directory          | Content                                                              |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/proc/devices`    | List devices (character- and block-devices), HD's, SSD's, ports ...  |
| `/proc/dma`        | List of used DMA channesl and the driver that uses it.               |
| `/proc/interrupts` | List of used interrupts, type of IRQ, using modules and number of occureces |

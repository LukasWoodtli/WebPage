# Transfer Function (Ãœbertragungsfunktion)

- Describes the dynamic behavior of a system over time
- Provides a calculation oof the output signal from any input signal
- Laplace transform of the impulse response

# Impulse Response (Gewichtsfunktion, Impulsantwort)

- Output signal for a Dirac impulse at input
- Completely describes an LTI (Linear Time-Invariant) system

# Frequency Response (Frequenzgang)

- Relationship between input/output of an LTI system
- Amplitude and phase (Complex quantity)
- Fourier transform of the impulse response

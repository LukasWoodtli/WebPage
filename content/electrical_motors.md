# AC Motors

High power, single- or multi-phase, constant torque and speed, large loads

# DC Motors

Normal DC motors almost linear characteristics:

- rotation speed determined by applied DC voltage
- output torque determined by current

Speed: few rpm (revolutions per minute) to many thousands rpm


## Brushed Motor

Cheap, small, easy to control

## Brushless Motors

Use Hall effect switches for stator field rotation sequence, smaller, more efficient, better torque/speed characteristics, more expensive than brushed motors

## Servo Motors

Brushed motor with positional feedback control, can be controlled by PWM.

A DC (RC) Servo Motor consists of a DC motor, gearbox, position feedback device and error correction (closed loop control).


## Stepper Motor

Accurate positioning, fast response to starting, stoping and reversing.

## Applicative order evaluation (eager evaluation)

All arguments to procedures are evaluated when provided to procedure
(when procedure is applied)

-   for example *Scheme* uses this evaluation strategy

## Normal order evaluation (lazy evaluation)

Delay the evaluation of procedure arguments until they are needed

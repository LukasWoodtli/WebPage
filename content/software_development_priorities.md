[TOC]

When developping software the priorities are as following:

1. correctness
2. maintainability
3. efficiency


## Correct SW

- Defensive Programming
- Unit Tests
- Contracts
- Static Analysis

## Maintainable SW

- Architecture
- Design Patterns
- Idioms
- Readable/intuitive code
- Correct and Actual Documentation


## Optimal, efficient (Optimized) SW

- Speed
- Size (Program Size, Memory Use)
- Dynamic Analysis
- No premature optimization
- Often code gets less readable/maintainable
- let the compiler/linker do the hard work

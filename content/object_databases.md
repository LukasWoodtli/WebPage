# Motivation

- Information Systems Design
    - Conceptual Design -> Technical Design -> Implementation

## Orthogonal Persistence

Data has to outlive the execution of the program


- **Independence** of longelivety of data
    - How much code needs to be written for persistence (effort for programmer)
        - None at all would be nice but not realistic (GUI objects usually don't need storing...)
    - Data is stored automatically
    - Not always desirable: don't need to store UI, messages ...
    - 3 possible solutions
        1. implicit: save all objects automatically
        2. explicit: objects need to be saved manually
        3. on class base (different granularity)
- **Data Type Orthogonality** all data objects should be allowed to be persistent (long-lived, transient)
    - The data types do not need to be modified (implicitly or explicitly) to allow persistence
    - e.g Serializable interface in Java does not satisfy this criteria (classes that don't implement the interface can't be stored)
- **Identification**: mechanism for identifying persistent object not related to the type system
    - Transferring data from persistence storage to memory
    - e.g specify which classes/objects should be stored persistence
    - separation of concerns

> No commercial DB system fully satisfies the above criteria

## Impedance Missmatch

- Difference between models
    - OOP data model is based on object trees
    - [The Relational Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_model) is based on tables
- OOP Languages
    - Difference between attributes and relationships not clear
    - Both are (usually) reference types in a class
- Different models because there are different requirements
- Mapping code between the two models needed
    - A lot of solutions available
    - Affects run-time (and often development)
- Inheritance (OOP) is difficult to model in relational DBs
    - Objects spread over several tables (other approaches possible)

An overview of the mismatch is shown on [Tutorialspoint](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/hibernate/orm_overview.htm)

| Mismatch    |                                                                                                         |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Granularity | An object model can have more classes than the number of corresponding tables in the DB.                |
| Inheritance | In OOP inheritance is a base concept. The Relational Model doesn't support this directly.              |
| Identity    | The Relational Model defines identity. In OOP there is often a difference between equality and identity. |
| Association | OOP uses references. The Relational Model uses foreign keys.                                            |
| Navigation  | OOP uses following references in object tree. The Relational Model uses queries.                        |


## Relational Databases

- Tables, Rows, Columns...
    - Table: Relation (similar to class)
    - Columns: Relation attributes (correspond to class attributes)
    - Keys: Pointers (relationships)

> It's difficult to match the relational database model to the object oriented model

## Object-relational mapping (ORM)

- [Object-relational mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping) can be used against object-relational miss-match
    - But it's not a very good approach
    - There are a lot of solutions: Hibernate, [QxOrm](http://www.qxorm.com/qxorm_en/home.html), ...


## Develop own Database

- Support application development (programming language)
    - Clients of the DB system are developers (not end user)
- Support persistent data management
- One data model (OOP)
- One language (Java?)

## SQL

### Data Definition Language (DDL)

Definition of data models

- Concepts
    - Relations
    - Relation attributes and domains
    - Primary and foreign key
- Operations
    - Create tables (`class` in Java)
    - Declare relation attributes
    - Declare primary and foreign keys
    - Alter tables

### Data Manipulation Language (DML)

Creation and management of data

- Concepts
    - Relation touple
    - Predicate
- Operations
    - Insert
    - Update
    - Delete
    - in Java: `new` and 'setters'

### Query Language (QL)

Retrieval of data

- Concepts
    - Query
    - Predicate
    - Query result
- Operations (Relational Algebra)
    - Project
    - Join
    - Select
    - in Java: 'getters'

## DDL, DML and QL in SQL and Java

DD, DM supported in Java. Querying is very limited.

- DD

SQL

    :::SqlLexer
    CREATE TABLE name ...

Java

    :::java
    class Person {
        String name;
        String email;
    }

- DM

SQL

    :::SqlLexer
    UPDATE name ...


Java


    :::java
    new Person()
    p.name = "Bill Stinnet"

- Querying

SQL

    :::SqlLexer
    SELECT col_name ...

Java

    :::java
    ... = p.name


LINQ is a powerful and compile time safe support for querying.

# General Topics for DB's

[Prepared Statement]

## CRUD and ACID

- The acronym [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) stands for the basic functions of a database system
    - Create
    - Read
    - Update
    - Delete

- The acronym [ACID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID) stands for the properties that allow for concurrent database transactions
    - Atomicity
    - Consistency
    - Isolation
    - Durability

<!-- Lecture 2 Slides/Notes Start -->

# ODMG Standard

- What is an object?
    - Something that can be pointed to?
    - Can be passed on as a reference?
    - Distinct from single values
    - properties and behaviour
    - representing something (moddeling the real world)

- Object:
    - properties
    - behaviour
    - presenting something (modelling the real world)

Examples in Java:

|           | Simple    | Complex  |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Reference | `Integer` | `Object` |
| Value     | `int`     |  N/A     |

In some languages (PHP, JavaScript, ...) Objects and Associative Arrays are the same (or similar).

- Some constructs can be extended over time
    - possible with map (add key/value)
    - *not* possible with *class* in Java

- Object Orientation needs a broader definition!
    - not coupled to a specific programming language

- Most database systems often independent of programming languages
    - e.g SQL very different from the language where the DB is used (independent of language)
- Object database systems are more coupled to one (or multiple) programming language


## Object Data Management Group (ODMG)

### Object Model

- Based on [OMG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Management_Group) object model
- Basic modeling primitives
    - **object**: unique identifier (identity)
    - **literal**: no identifier
- Object state defined by the values (properties)
    - attributes
    - relationships
- Object behavior
    - set of operations (can be executed)

- Objects and literals are categorized by their type
    - A type defines common properties and common behavior

#### Types

- Specification
    - properties
        - attributes
        - relationships
    - operations
    - exceptions
- Implementation
    - language binding
    - a specification can have more than one implementation
- Similar to C++
    - Header-File: Specification
    - Source-File: Implementation

#### Type Specifications
- Interface
    - defines only abstract behavior
    - `interface Employee {...};`
- Class
    - defines both abstract behavior and abstract state
    - `class Person {...};`
- Literal
    - defines abstract state
    - `struct Complex { float real; float imaginary; };`

#### Type Implementation

- Representation
    - data structure
    - derived from type's abstract state by the language binding
    - for each property contained in the abstract state there is an instance variable of an appropriate type defined
- Methods
    - procedure bodies
    - derived from type's abstract behavior by the language binding
    - also private methods with no counterpart in specification

#### Subtyping and Inheritance

- Two types of inheritance relationships
    1. IS-A relationship
        - inheritance of behavior
        - multiple inheritance, name overloading disallowed
        - `interface Professor : Employee {...};`
    2. **EXTENDS** relationship
        - inheritance of state and behavior
        - single inheritance
        - `class EmplPers extends Person : Employee {...};`

- Co- and Contravariant rules must hold
    - Input Arguments: Contravariant
    - Return Values (and Exceptions): Covariant

### Object Query Language (OQL)

Based on ODMG Object Model and SQL-92

    :::SqlLexer
    select  list_of_values
    from    list_of_collections_and_typical_members
    where   condition


- `SELECT`: Get attributes
- `FROM`: The base population of potential results to search in
- `WHERE`: Predicates (conditions) that have to be true so that the results are selected as result

Mapping to OOP not obvious.

Table in relational DBs has tow roles:

1. Defining Type
2. Container of all values (of that type)

In OOP 2. is missing. A class just defines a type but is not a container of all instances of that class.

ODMG defines Extents.


#### Difference to SQL

This is illegal as the "dot" operator cannot be applied to a collection of objects:

    :::SqlLexer
    select a.authors.title
    from   Authors a
    where  a.name = "Tilmann Zaeschke"

Correct solution based on *correlated* variables:

    :::SqlLexer
    select p.title
    from Authors a, a.authors p
    where a.name = "Tilmann Zaeschke"

#### Return Types

- Queries return sets, bags or lists

As a default, queries return a *bag*

    :::SqlLexer
    select first: p.authored_by[1], p.title, p.year
    from   Publications p

In Java:

    :::java
    Bag<Struct { Author first, string title, integer year }>

Queries with `DISTINCT` return a *set*

    :::SqlLexer
    select distinct a.name
    from   Authors a

In Java:

    :::java
    Set<Struct { string name }>

Queries with `ORDER BY` return a *list*

    :::SqlLexer
    select p.title
    from Publications s order by p.year desc

In Java:

    :::java
    List<Struct { string name }>


#### Extents

- Extent of a type is the set (collection) of all active instances
    - `class Person`: extent of class Person would be the set of all person objects in the data management system
- Extents can be maintained automatically

### Collections

OMDG supports collections:



 - set: un-ordered, no duplicates
 - bag: un-ordered, duplicates
 - list: ordered, elements can be inserted
 - array: ordered, elements can be replaced
 - dictionary: maps keys to values

|            | Single elements | Duplicates  |
|------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Ordered    | ? (heap)        | list        |
| Un-ordered | set             | bag         |

Support for objects and literals:

- Collection objects: `Set<t>`, `Bag<t>`, `List<t>`, `Array<t>`, `Dictionary<t,v>`
- Collection literals: `set<t>`, `bag<t>`, `list<t>`, `array<t>`, `dictionary<t,v>`

#### Sub-collections

OMDG supports sub-collections

### Relationships

- All relationships are binary
    - many-to-many
    - many-to-one
    - one-to-one
- No support for ternary (or higher) relationships
    - can be simulated by creating classes to represent relationship touple
- System maintains referential integrity!

- Keywords for attributes and relationships
    - `attribute`: for normal class attributes
    - `relationship`: for relationship references (integrity checks can be performed)

### Persistence
- Persistence by reachability
    - not necessary the best option
- Database gives access to global names
    - explicitly *named root objects*
    - types defined in schema
    - named extents of types
    - store object graphs

### Other Concepts Supported
- Database operations
- Locking and concurrency control
- Transactions
- Access to meta-data
- Built-in structured literals and objects
    - dates
    - times
    - time-stamps
    - intervals
    - ...

### Object Definition Language (ODL)

- programming language independent, extensible and practical
- compatible to OMG Interface Definition Language (IDL)

ODL Syntax:

    :::java
    class name [ ( extent name, key name ) ] {
      { exception name { { type name } } }
      { attribute type name }
      { relationship type name inverse relationship }
      { type name({ (in|out|inout) type name })[raises ({ exception })] }
    }


- extent and key of a class can be specified optionally
- relationships specify inverse to maintain referential integrity
- method signatures are implemented by language binding


### Collection Expressions
- Aggregate operators
    - `AVG`, `SUM`, `MIN`, `MAX`, and `COUNT` apply to collections that have a compatible member type
- Operations for sets and bags
    - `UNION`, `INTERSECTION` and `EXCEPT`
    - inclusion tests (subset, super-set)
- Special operations for lists
    - Simple coercion
    - a collection of one element can be coerced to that element using the `ELEMENT` operator
- Flattening a collection of collections


### Language Bindings

- C++
- Java
- Smalltalk
- ...

# Hibernate

- Example of a [Object-relational mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping) tool
- Challenges
    - Data has to outlive the execution of the program
    - The program is written in an OOP language

![Mappings](/images/object_databases/db_mappings.svg)

- Problems of Object Identity
    - Two object graphs can point to same objects
    - Duplicates can be created When deserialized
    - Programmer must take care to avoid multiplicity!
- Object Identity
    - Multiple models
    - Impedance mismatch
    - Transformation must be implemented (Design Time)
    - Transformation must be carried out (Run Time)
    - Must be implemented for each application
- Possible use of SQL
    - Integrating a relational database at the level of SQL (e.g. JDBC, Google Android, PHP mysqli)
        - OK for simple application domains (e.g. few classes with base type attributes)
        - Not OK for complex application domains (e.g. many classes with reference type attributes, multi-valued attributes, associations, inheritance)

## Object-Relational Mappings

- Map object-oriented domain model to relational database
    - Hibernate
        - Free implementation for Java
        - maps Java types to SQL types
        - transparent persistence for classes meeting certain requirements
        - generates SQL for more than 25 dialects behind the scenes
        - provides data query and retrieval using either HQL or SQL
        - can be used stand-alone with Java SE or in Java EE applications
    - Java Persistence API (JPA)
        - Defines interface (and annotations) to use y other systems
        - Enterprise Java Beans Standard 3.0
        - introduced annotations to define mapping
        - javax.persistence package

## Main Concepts

- `Configuration`
    - Connection to database (hibernate.properties or hibernate.cfg.xml)
    - Which DBMS? (MySQL, HSQL, ...)
    - Which DB Instance? (Database Name)
    - Mappings between classes and database tables
    - The Configuration object is created at first
        - usually created only once during application initialization
- `SessionFactory`
    - Created by using the configuration object
    - Session objects can be created and supplied with configuration
    - Heavyweight object: create during start up and keep for later use
    - multiple databases require multiple `SessionFactory` objects
- `Session` object
    - Used to get physical connection to the database
    - lightweight
    - designed to be instantiated each time an interaction with the DB is needed
    - Persistent objects are *stored* and *retrieved* through `Session` object
    - should not be kept open for a long time
        - usually not thread safe
        - create before use
        - destroy after use
- `Transaction` object
    - represent a unit of work with the DB
    - handled by underlying transaction manager and transaction (JDBC or JTA)
    - optional object
        - transactions can be managed in own application code
- `Query` object
    - SQL or Hibernate Query Language (HQL)
    - bind query parameters
    - limit number of results
    - execute query
- `Criteria` object
    - used to create and execute *object oriented* criteria queries to retrieve objects

## Configuration

- Hibernate needs to know where to find some information about class mappings and database
- XML file: *hibernate.cfg.xml* (or Java properties file *hibernate.properties*)

### Properties

| Property          | Description                                       |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| hibernate.dialect | The SQL dialect used to generate persistence code |
| hibernate.connection.driver_class | The JDBC driver class             |
| hibernate.connection.url          | The URL to the database instance  |
| hibernate.connection.username     | The username for the database     |
| hibernate.connection.password     | The password for the database     |
| hibernate.connection.pool_size    | The number of connections in the Hibernate database connection pool |
| hibernate.connection.autocommit   | Autocommit mode for the JDBC connection |


There are additional settings for using a database along with an application server and JNDI.

### Persistent Objects

Only Plain Old Java Object (POJO) can be saved in the DB.

Requirements:

- Default constructor
- Class should contain an ID
    - Maps to the primary key column in DB table
- Attributes should be private
    - Public accessor functions (getter, setter) need to be provided
    - JavaBean style accessors: getXYZ, setXYZ
- Persistence class either
    - non-final or
    - implementation of interface that declares all public methods
- Some additional minor restrictions from EJB framework


Example:

    :::java
    SessionFactory factory = new Configuration().configure().buildSessionFactory();

- Session
    - Connection to a database instance
    - Created when we want to work with a database
    - Using a Session object, we can store and retrieve application data
    - Methods:
        - save
        - createQuery
        - update
        - delete

Example:

    :::java
    Session session = factory.openSession();
    ...
    session.save(person);
    ...
    session.close();

- Transaction
    - Opened with a Session object `beginTransaction()` and closed using `commit()`

Example:

    :::java
    Transaction tx = session.beginTransaction();
    ...
    tx.commit();

- Query
    - Represents a query (e.g. `SELECT * FROM PERSONS`, HQL).
    - Result is a list

Example:

    :::java
    List persons = session.createQuery("FROM Persons").list();
    for (Object p: persons)
      { ... }

- Criteria
    - An object-oriented representation of query criteria

## Mapping Associations

- Uni- and bidirectional associations
- Unordered and ordered associations
- Association cardanality types
    - one-to-one
    - many-to-one
    - one-to-many
    - many-to-many
- Join Tables to map complex associations

Example:

    :::SqlLexer
    CREATE TABLE AUTHOR(AUTHOR_ID BIGINT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, ...)
    CREATE TABLE AUTHORSPUBLICATIONS(
      AUTHOR_ID BIGINT NOT NULL,
      PUBLICATION_ID BIGINT NOT NULL,
      PRIMARY KEY(AUTHOR_ID, PUBLICATION_ID))
    CREATE TABLE PUBLICATION(PUBLICATION_ID BIGINT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, ... )

## Mapping Inheritance

- Multiple strategies
    - One table per class hierarchy
    - One table per subclass
    - One table per concrete class
- Mapping strategies can be mixed
    - Different parts of inheritance hierarchy can have different strategy
- Implicit polymorphism
    - One table per concrete class
    - Common interface *not* mentioned in the mapping
    - Common properties are mapped in *every* table

## Annotations

- Since Java 5
- Java Persistence API (JPA, Enterprise Java Beans 3.0)
- Annotations instead of XML for mapping
- Standardizes ORM
- Hibernate implements JPA

# Google Android

- Linux based OS
- Default applications: Search, Maps, Mail, Calendar, Contacts...
- Java SDK
- Support for persistent data management
- Smart Phone / Tablet

## Application component model

- Activity (UI)
- Service (API, Computation)
- Broadcast Receiver (Events)
- Content Provider (Data Management)

- Manifest
    - lists the application components
    - sets activity to be shown at startup
    - components can be made available to other applications
- Intent: request the use of application components (integration with other apps)
    - showing activities
    - using content provides
    - listening to events
    - starting services
    - ...
- [Application Life-cycle](http://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities.html)
    - States: New Activity, Running, Paused, Stopped, Destroyed
    - Extend `Activity`
    - Application can react to state changes

## Data Management

- Low-level: SQL
- High-level: Content Provider
- Database Instance
    - SQLite
    - **CRUD**
        - **C**reate (Insert)
        - **R**ead (Retrieve, Query)
        - **U**pdate
        - **D**elete
- Cursor
    - Iterator over result
    - Methods `isLast()` and `moveToNext()`
    - Type specific getter methods (e.g `getInt(3)`)
    - Access with index
    - Index can be retrieved `getColumnIndex(String colName)`

- Content Provider
    - Abstract class implemented by application
    - Uses
        - Cursor
        - URI
        - ContentValue


<!-- OODB Manifesto start -->
# Object-Oriented Databases: Object Database Manifesto

- Avoid impedance mismatch
- Provide uniform data model
- Combine features of
    - OOP
    - Database Management Systems

- The object-oriented database manifesto
    - 13 mandatory features
    - 5 optional characteristics
    - 4 open choices
    - several important topics not addressed

- Object-oriented systems (mandatory)
    - 1\. Complex objects
    - 2\. Object identity
    - 3\. Encapsulation
    - 4\. Types and classes
    - 5\. Type and class hierarchies
    - 6\. Overriding, overloading and late binding
    - 7\. Computational completeness
    - 8\. Extensibility

- Database management systems (mandatory)
    - 9\. Persistence
    - 10\. Efficiency
    - 11\. Concurrency
    - 12\. Reliability
    - 13\. Declarative query language

## Objects (mandatory)

- Complex objects
    - build from simpler objects (constructor)
    - collections
- Object identity and equality
    - Object ID (OID)
        - unique and immutable
    - sharing of objects (references)
    - *identical* objects have same OID
    - *equal* objects have same state
    - shallow and deep equality
- Touple: entities and their attributes
- Sets: collections of entities
- Lists: order

- Constructor orthogonality
    - supports arbitrary nesting such as
        - sets of sets
        - set of records
        - records containing records
        - ...
    - In contrast, relational databases only support
        - sets of records (relation with touple) and
        - touple containing atomic values
- Complex objects also require
    - transitive retrieval and deletion of objects
    - deep and shallow copying
    - ...
- Encapsulation
    - interface
        - signatures of public methods
    - implementation
        - includes data and methods
    - object state modification only through public methods
    - object data structure may be *exposed* for *declarative queries*!

## Types and Classes

- Data types
    - definition of object properties
    - static part: object structure
    - dynamic part: object behavior
    - separation of interface and implementation
    - Check of correctness at compile time
- Object classes
    - container for objects of the same type
    - objects can be added and removed
    - used to add, remove and iterate over all existing objects
        - to present, manipulate ... them

## Generalization Hierarchies

- Powerful modeling tool
- Reuse (specification and implementation)
- Inheritance
    - Substitution principle
    - Inherited attributes and methods (from super-class)
    - New attributes and methods can be added (in subclass)
- Migration between classes
    - move objects between hierarchy levels
    - object specialization and generalization

## Durability and Efficiency
- Persistence
    - data has to survive the program execution
    - orthogonal persistence
    - implicit persistence
- Secondary storage management
    - index management
    - data clustering
    - data buffering
    - access path selection
    - query optimization


- Orthogonality
    - Persistence applicable to all objects of any type
    - No additional code necessary
    - Moving objects between persistent and memory representation is not needed

- Similar requirements for  secondary storage management
    - As a rule of thumb:
        - a database should work without it, but with it, it should perform better
    - If this requirement is met, a complete separation of the logical and physical level is achieved

## Concurrency Control and Recovery
- Concurrency
    - management of multiple users concurrently interacting
    - atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability
    - serialisability of operations
- Reliability
    - resiliency to user, software and hardware failures
    - transactions can be committed or aborted
    - restore previous coherent state of data
    - redoing and undoing of transactions
    - logging of operations

## Declarative Query Language
- High-level language
    - express non-trivial queries concisely
    - text-based or graphical interface
    - declarative
- Efficient execution
    - possibility for query optimization
    - Application independent
    - work on any possible database
    - no need for additional methods on user-defined types

# db4o

- Open Source project
    - Java and .NET
- Features
    - No conversion of mapping needed
    - Classes don't need to be changed to make them persistent (datatype orthogonality)
    - One line of code to store (complex) objects
    - local or client/server mode
    - ACID transaction model
    - Automatic management and versioning of database schema
    - Small memory foot-print (single 2Mb library)

## Object Container

- Represents db4o databases
    - local file mode or
    - client connections to db4o server
- Owns one transaction
    - operations are executed transactions
    - transaction is started when object container is opened
    - after commit/rollback next transaction is started automatically
- Manages link between stored and instantiated objects
    - object identities
    - loading, updating, unloading

## Storing Objects

- Store objects with method `ObjectContainer.store(...)`
- Arbitrary complex objects can be stored
- Persistence by reachability

## Retrieving Objects

- 3 Query languages
    1. Query by Example
        - simple
        - based on prototype objects
        - selects *exact* matches only
    2. Native Queries
        - expressed in application programming language
        - type safe
        - transformed to SODA (optimized)
    3. Simple Object Data Access (SODA)
        - query API based on query graph
        - methods for descending graph and applying constraints

### SODA Queries

- Expressed using `Query` objects
    - `descend` adds or traverses a node in the query tree
    - `constrain` adds a constraint to a node in the query tree
    - `sortBy` sorts the result set
    - `orderAscending` and `orderDescending`
    - `execute` executes the query
- Interface Constraint
    - `greater` and `smaller` comparison modes
    - `identity`, `equal` and `like` evaluation modes
    - `and`, `or` and `not` operators
    - `startsWith` and `endsWith` string comparisons
    - `contains` to test collection membership

## Updating Objects

- Update procedure for persistent object
    - retrieve desired object from the database
    - perform the required changes/modifications
    - store object back to the database (calling `store` method)
- db4o uses IDs to connect in-memory objects with stored objects
- IDs are cached

## Deleting Objects

- similar to updating objects
- Method `ObjectContainer.delete(...)` removes objects

## Simple vs. Complex Objects

- Simple Structured Objects (objects in classical sense):
    - properties
    - methods
- Complex Object Structures: multivalued attrivutes
    - arrays
    - collections
    - ...

## Simple Structured Objects

- New objects are stored using the `store` method
    - Persistence by reachability
        - Object graph is traversed, each referenced object is stored
- Updating objects with `store` method
    - Update depth *1* by default
    - Only primitives and strings are updated
    - No traversal of object graph (performance)
- Deleting objects with `delete` method
    - Not cascaded by default
    - Referenced objects have to be deleted manually
    - Cascading delete can be configured for individual classes

### Updating Simple Structured Objects

- Cascading updates are configured per class with `ObjectClass.cascadeOnUpdate(..)`
- Update depth can be configured
    - `ExtObjectContainer.store(object, depth)` updates referenced objects to given depth
    - `ObjectClass.updateDepth(depth)` defines update depth for a class (and all its objects)
    - `Configuration.updateDepth(depth)` sets global update depth for all objects

### Deleting Simple Structured Objects

- Cascading deletes similar to cascading updates
    - configured per object class
    - `CommonConfiguration.objectClass (...)`
    - `ObjectClass.cascadeOnDelete(..)`
    - What happens if deleted objects referenced elsewhere???
    - Cache and disk can become inconsistent when deleting objects
        - `ExtObjectContainer.refresh(..)` syncs objects

## Object Hierarchies

- Complex object structures are handled automatically
    - hierarchies, composite hierarchies
    - inverse associations
    - inheritance and interfaces
    - multi-valued attributes, arrays and collections
- db4o database-aware collections
    - `ArrayList4` and `ArrayMap4` implement Collections API
    - as part of transparent persistence/activation framework
      - `ActivatableArrayList`, `ActivatableHashMap`, ...
    - complex object implementation becomes *db4o dependent*

## Transparent Persistence

- Persistence should be transparent to application logic
    - Store objects in database *once* (`store` method)
    - avoid multiple calls of `store`
- Logic of transparent persistence framework
    - `Activatable` interface (no datatype orthogonality)
    - objects are made persistent by `store` method
    - objects bound to transparent persistence framework with `bind`method
    - commit: transparent persistent framework scans for modified objects and invokes `store`

Enabling transparent persistence

    :::java
    config.add(new TransparentPersistenceSupport());

## Activation

- Activation controls depth of loaded fields
    - field values (objects) are loaded in memory to a certain depth when query retrieves objects
    - activation depth: length of reference chain
    - fields beyond activation depth: default value (e.g `null`)
- Activation cases
    - `ObjectSet.next(...)` called on an query result
    - explicit `ObjectContainer.activate(...)`
    - db4o collection element accessed
    - members of Java collections are activated automatically when collection is activated
- Controlling activation
    - default depth: 5
    - `ObjectContainer.activate(..)` and `ObjectContainer.deactivate()`
- per class configuration

Methods for per class configuration of activation depth

    :::java
    ObjectClass#minimumActivationDepth(minDepth)
    ObjectClass#maximumActivationDepth(maxDepth)
    ObjectClass#cascadeOnActivate(bool)
    ObjectClass#objectField(...).cascadeOnActivate(bool)

### Transparent Activation

- Make activation transparent to application logic
    - activate fields automatically when accessed
- Logic of transparent activation framework
    - `Activable` interface (no datatype orthogonality)
    - at object instantiation db registers itself in object with `bind(..)`

Enabling the transparent activation framework

    :::java
    config.add(new TransparentActivationSupport());

## db4o Transactions

- ACID
- Data transaction journaling
    - no data loss in case of system failure
    - automatic data recovery after system failure
- thread-safe for simultaneous interactions
- all work in `ObjectContainer`is transactional
    - transaction started when container opened
    - current transaction committed when container closed
    - explicit commit and rollback possible
        - `ObjectContainer.commit(...)`
        - `ObjectContainer.rollback(...)`

## Configuration

- Embedded
    - `Db4oEmbedded.newConfiguration()`
- Client/Server
    - `Db4oClientServer.newClientConfiguration()`
    - `Db4oClientServer.newServerConfiguration()`

## External tools
- performance tuning
- database diagnostics
- Indexes
    - optimize query evaluation
- Defragment
    - removes unused fields, classes, management information
    - compacts db file, faster access
    - command line interface or from application
- Statistics
    - queries
    - objects: stored, retrieved, activated, ...
    - I/O, Network, ...
- Logger
    - logs objects in db
    - logs objects of a given class
    - run from command line

## Indexes

- Trade-off between
    - increased query performance
    - decreased storage, update and delete performance
- Set by configuration or annotation (`@Indexed`)
- B-Tree based indexes on single object fields

## Tuning for Speed

- Heuristic to improve performance
    - weak references
    - BTree node size
    - free-space manager
    - locking
    - flushing
    - callbacks
    - caches
    - ...
- Object loading
    - use appropriate activation depth
    - use multiple object or session containers
    - disable weak references if not required
- Database tests
    - disable detection of schema changes
    - disable instantiation tests of persistence classes at start-up
- Query evaluation
    - set field indexes on most used objects to improve searches
    - optimize native queries

## Distribution and Replication

- Embedded mode
    - DB accessed by clients in same *JVM*
    - direct file access: 1 user and 1 thread at a time
    - client session: 1 user and multiple threads
    - Database file opened, locked and accessed directly
        - `Db4oEmbedded.openFile(configuration, name)`
- Client/Server mode
    - Clients in multiple *JVMs*
    - DB access on server
    - Client opens TCP/IP connection to server
        - `Db4oClientServer.openServer(filename, port)`
        - `Db4oClientServer.openClient(host, port, user, pass)`
    - Client sends query, insert, update and delete instructions to server
    - Client receives data from the server
- Replication
    - redundant copies of database on multiple servers
    - changes replicated form *master* to *client* servers
    - several forms of replication supported
        - snapshot replication
        - transactional replication
        - merge replication
    - needs to be coded into application
        - cannot be configured on admin level
        - replication only on demand
        - client/server semantics introduced by developer
        - one interface for all forms of replication
    - Replication Modes
        - Snapshot Replication
            - Snapshots of master replicated to client
            - state-based
            - periodical schedule
            - special SODA query to detect all new and updated objects
        - Transactional Replication
            - Changes synchronized after transaction
            - operation based
            - changes replicated immediately
            - Single object replication with `ReplicationSession`
        - Merge Replication
            - Changes from clients merged to central server
            - Other clients updated to reflect changes
            - Transactionally of on a periodic basis
            - Typically if subscribers are occasionally offline
- Replication System
    - Separated from db4o core
    - uni- or bidirectional replication
    - Replication of relational databases based on Hibernate
    - Supported replication providers
        - db4o &rarr; db4o
        - db4o &rarr; Hibernate
        - Hibernate &rarr; db4o
        - Hibernate &rarr; Hibernate
    - 3 steps required
        1. Generating unique IDs and version numbers
        2. Creating a `ReplicationSession`
        3. Replicating objects
    - Mode dependent on implementation
    - Bidirectional by default
        - Unidirectional can be configured
            - `ReplicationSession.setDirection(from, to)`
        - `ReplicationSession.replicate(object)` newer object transferred to DB
        - Object granularity
    - Conflict handling has to be done by developer

## Callbacks

- Called in response to events
    - activate
    - deactivate
    - new
    - update
    - delete
- Methods called before and after event
    - `can...` called *before* event
    - `on...` called *after* event
- Interface `ObjectCallbacks`
- Use Cases
    - Recording or preventing updates
        - `canUpdate()` and `onUpdate()`
    - Setting default values after *refactoring*
        - `canNew()`
    - Checking object integrity before storing objects
        - `canNew()` and `canUpdate()`
    - Restoring state when objects activated
        - Update UI, restore network connections, ...


## Object Instantiation

- Three different techniques for instantiation
    1. Constructor
    2. Bypassing Constructor
    3. Translator
- Bypassing Constructor is default (if available)
- Can be configured globally or per class
- Constructors
    - db4o tries first default constructor
    - if not public default constructor available
        - all constructors are tested to create instance
        - default values (e. g `null`) passed as arguments
        - first successfully tested constructor is used
        - if no instance of a class can be created, object can't be stored

Configuration interface:

    :::java
    // global setting (default: depends on environment)
    CommonConfiguration#callConstructors(true)
    // per class setting (default: depends on environment)
    CommonConfiguration#objectClass(...).callConstructors(true)
    // exceptions for debugging (default: true)
    CommonConfiguration#exceptionsOnNotStorable(true)

- Bypassing Constructors
    - Constructors that cannot handle default values or `null` must be bypassed
    - platform specific mechanism
    - Not all environments support this feature
    - Default setting (if supported by environment)
    - Breaks classes that rely on constructors being executed
- Translators
    - needed if neither Constructors nor Bypassing Constructors can be used
    - if constructor needed to populate transient members
    - if constructor fails when called with default values
    - Interfaces `ObjectTranslator` and `ObjectConstructor`
- Type Handles
    - instead of Translators at lower level
    - type handler registered for class that it handles
    - write to and read from byte-arrays

# Versant

- Highly scalable
- Distributed
- Many platforms and programming languages
    - C, C++, Java
- db4o acquired by Versant
- Lot of features
- easy to use
- Full Persistence Orthogonality
    - but code is injected (into byte-code)

## Indexing

- Like SQL
- Point/Range queries
- Index structures for Relational DBs not ideal for Subtyping
    - *Polymorphic indexes* in Versant

## Architecture

- Always network based
    - no embedded option (as db4o)
- Client
    - Versant Manager
    - Object cache
    - Application logic
- Versant Server
    - possible to use multiple servers
    - Access to data
        - Volumes (page cache)
    - Logical log file
    - Physical log file
- Dual cache
    - Object cache (client)
    - Page cache (server)

## Database Volumes

- System Volume (created automatically)
    - Class descriptions
    - Object instances
- Data Volumes (optional)
    - Increase database capacity
    - Partition data
- Logical Log Volume (created automatically)
    - Transactions and redo information
    - For recovery and rollback
- Physical Log Volume (created automatically)
    - Physical data information
    - For recovery and rollback

## Versant Manager

- Presents objects to app
- Caches objects in virtual memory
- Manages transactions
- Distributes queries and updates to servers
- Conversion between Versant DB format and client machine format

## Cache

- Cached Object Descriptor Table
- Map from *logical object identifier* (LOID) to object in memory
    - attributes pointing to other object: access object in memory or DB


![Nested Index](/images/object_databases/versant_cache.png)


| pointer  | LOID     | Meaning                |
|----------|----------|------------------------|
| NULL     | NULL     | object deleted?        |
| not NULL | NULL     | not saved persistently |
| NULL     | not NULL | not loaded in cache    |
| not NULL | not NULL | in DB and in cache     |

Other entries:

- locking information
- state information
- ...

## Versant Server

- Object retrieval (disk and page cache)
- Transactions and locks
- Logging and recovery
- Indexing

Versant doesn't have the notion of activation. Data is retrieved automatically
when dereferencing pointers.

## Processes, Sessions and Transactions

- Session (same as ObjectContainer in db4o)
    - On client side
    - Represents database instance
    - Container
    - A session object is always bound to one *single transaction*
    - It's possible to have multiple threads attached to one session
        - This is dangerous!
        - Not transaction support
    - Multiple sessions within separate threads
    - or multiple session in one thread
    - Each session object on the client is bound to one transaction thread in the server
        - Transaction (ACID) support
    - The server thread accesses the page cache

## Java Versant Interface

- Easy-to-use storage of persistent Java objects
    - pure Java (syntax and semantics)
    - instances of nearly all classes can be stored (and accessed)
    - works with Java GC
- Client-server architecture
    - access to the Versant object DB
    - client libs cache objects for faster access
    - DB queries are executed on server
- Configuration and code-generation integrated in build process

## JVI Layers

Versant provides different API layers.
The fundamental layer is usually not directly needed by the application developer.

### Fundamental Layer

- DB centric
- Create 'Meta-classes'
- Objects manipulated indirectly through handles
- package `com.versant.fund`
- Query classes `FundQuery` and `FundQueryResult`

- Create wrapper code for real classes (reflection)


### Transparent Layer

- language centric
- usually used by developer
- code is injected to application code
- build on top of fundamental layer
- package `com.versant.trans`
- Java classes are mapped to objects in fundamental layer
- Persistent objects are cached in memory
- For persistent objects retrieved from a DB Java objects are constructed (in memory)


#### First and Second Class Objects

Versant distinguishes first class and second class objects

- Configured externally in a file
- Configured on class basis
- First Class Objects (FCO)
    - main objects that can be saved and retrieved independently
    - have a Logical Object Identifier (LOID)
    - changes are saved automatically (independence)
    - strong entities
- Second Class Objects (SCO)
    - can be saved only as part of an FCO
    - can't be results of queries
    - can be part of first class objects
    - stored as binary array
    - weak entity
    - used for optimization

#### Persistence Categories

- can be configured on class basis

- First class objects
    - Persistent always (*p*)
        - becomes persistent at instantiation (independence)
        - marked as dirty when modified
    - Persistence capable (*c*)
        - new instances are transient but can become persistent
        - marked as dirty when modified
    - Super-class of *p* or *c* must also be *p* or *c* respectively
- Second class objects
    - Transparent dirty owner (*d*)
        - changes to object automatically mark the owner object as dirty
        - works only when the owner is stored (FCO)
    - Persistence aware (*a*)
        - for code that is aware of FCO
        - code needs to mark manually the FCO as dirty
    - Not persistent (*n*)
        - no managed by Versant system


#### Persistence and Navigation

- Persistence by reachability is provided
- Database root
    - persist the root of an object graph
    - name it (for retrieving it later)
    - Methods `makeRoot()`, `deleteRoot()` and `findRoot()`
- Transparent navigation
    - 'activation' handled automatically and lazy
    - objects are transparently locked and retrieved
    - works across DB boundaries

### OMDG Layer

- language centric
- ODMG database, transactions, collections
- build on transparent layer
- packages `com.versant.odmg` and `com.versant.odmg`

## Application Development

- Develop Java classes
    - make code 'persistence aware'
    - sessions, transactions, concurrency
- Create configuration file
    - specify persistence category for each Java class
- Compile
- Run enhancer to make byte-code changes
    - persistence behavior inherited from `com.versant.trans.Persistent`
    - explicit at compile time or
    - implicit at run time (class loader)
- create DB
- Run application

## Byte-code Enhancement

- Code which creates schema object in DB
- Code for writing and reading to and from DB
- Code for accessing attribute values

## Object Lifecycle

- Creation of persistent objects
    - Java objects in memory
    - Each object has internal DB information in object cache
- Commit
    - Object data written to DB
    - Proxy Java objects retained in memory
- Rollback
    - New database objects will be dropped
- Querying
    - Queries are passed to DB server
    - Proxy object for every object in result
- Accessing objects
    - Objects are fetched or de-serialized transparently

## Versant Collections

- Standard collection classes can't be byte-code enhanced
- Special collection classes for *FCO*s and *SCO*s
- Scalable large collections (*FCO*)
- OMDG collections (are *FCO*s)
    - additional query facilities

## Versant Query Language (VQL)

- Subset of OQL (ODMG)
- Similar to SQL
- Executed on server
- Can be parameterised
    - prepared statements

## Event Notification and Persistent Object Hooks

- Like callbacks in db4o
- Event Notification
    - Propagation of events from DB to client
    - Event types
        - class: create, modify or delete an instance
        - object: modify or delete object or group of objects
        - transactions: begin or end of transaction
        - user-defined events
    - package `com.versant.event`
- Persistent Object Hooks
    - Allow intervention of state transitions
    - `activate()`, `deactivate()`
    - `preRead(boolean act)` and `postRead(boolean act)`
    - `preWrite(boolean deAct)` and `postWrite(boolean deAct)`
    - `vDelete()`: can be used to maintain referential integrity (cascading delete)

# ObjectStore

## General Topics of Persistence
- Orthogonal persistence is not always desired (UI, messages, ...)
- Persistence identification: do we need to explicit store/retrieve objects
- Possibility to select what is in DB and what is in memory
- Declarative query language
    - what, not how
    - more power-full
    - easy to use
    - more expressive
- Difference between
    - persistent always: stored automatically
    - persistent capable: needs to be stored explicitly

## Architecture

- C++ and Java
- Client/Server application
- Lightweight and professional editions available
- Based on virtual memory mapping
    - pages
    - cache forward architecture (very performant)
- Virtual memory mapping architecture (extends operating system)
    - logical vs. physical address
    - page fault
    - address translation
- Characteristics (ObjectStore)
    - virtual
    - shared
    - distributed
    - heterogeneous
    - persistent
    - transactional
- Logical vs. physical address
    - data is referenced uniquely using a 4-part key
        1. database
        2. segment
        3. cluster
        4. offset (in cluster)
    - theoretical address space to $2^{128}$
    - Reserved virtual memory region for persistence: Persistent Storage Region (*PSR*)
- Physical memory and secondary storage
    - all data accessed by client must be in *PSR*
    - cache hold recently accessed data even across transactions
- Data is cached on different levels
- Granularity: pages
- close to persistence capable (in Versant)
    - overloaded `new` operator
    - instance based persistence

## Virtual Memory Mapping Architecture

- Page faults
    - ObjectStore maps data into app when page fault occurs
    - data is paged into memory from cache if not in *PSR* or fetched from server if not in cache
- Address translation
    - done when data is fetched into cache
    - re-translation can occur (when *PSR* gets full)
    - trade-off
        - nice to have the ability to use direct SW pointers
        - translating pointers has scalability implications

## Server Side Components

- Server
    - Enforces ACID using 'page permits'
    - co-operation between servers with two-phase commits
    - automatic recovery mechanism
- Database
    - managed by one server
        - one server can manage multiple DBs (distribution)
    - binary files storing pages of memory containing C++ objects
- Transaction log
    - each server owns transaction log
    - pages only propagated to DB when transaction commits
    - used for
        - automatic recovery
        - faster commits
        - Multi-version Concurrency Control (MVCC)
        - ...

## Client Side Components

- Client
    - C++ program linked with ObjectStore libraries
    - even Java programs using ObjectStore are embedded (session) in a C++ part
    - interacts with DB
    - pages automatically fetched from DB
- Cache
    - one cache memory mapped file per client process
    - pages fetched from DB are held in cache
    - pages can be retained in cache between transactions
    - Cache manager retrieves data from the server
- meta-information (Commseg)
    - Commseg memory mapped file
    - contains meta-information about pages in cache
    - stores *permit* and *lock* for pages in cache
    - *permit*s can be retained between transactions
- Cache manager
    - one manager per client machine
    - shared by all clients on that machine
    - handles permit revokes
    - read/write cache and Commseg
    - not directly involved in page fetch
- Persistent Storage Region (*PSR*)
    - reserved area of virtual address space (in C++ part)
    - addresses of persistent objects used by client are mapped to *PSR*
    - pointers of application will be in the range of the *PSR*
    - at end of transaction *PSR* is cleared
        - can be reused for next transaction

## Fetching and Mapping Pages

- Client automatically fetches and maps pages
    - 'lazy' fetches
    - held in client cache
- Server *permits* and client *locks* acquired automatically
    - ensuring transaction consistency
- Existing page can be swapped out
    - if not enough room in cache for new page
    - updated pages are sent to the server
    - read-only pages are dropped from cache (copy in DB)

### Fetching and Mapping Sequence

- ObjectStore installs `SIGSEGV` (segmentation fault) handler
- Program obtains pointer `p` to object on page *x*
- Dereferencing `p` causes `SIGSEGV` handler to be called
- Virtual mapping table is consulted
- Page is fetched from server and stored in cache
- Page *x* is mapped to address space
- Execution continues

## Cache-Forward Architecture

- To provide *high performance* in ObjectStore
    - data cached across transaction boundaries
    - number of used locks is reduces
    - cached data kept in globally consistent state
- Two types of locks on pages
    - *transaction locks*: represents state of page during transaction
    - *ownership permits*: represents state of page in cache
- *Permits* are tracked by *server*
    - server serves permits on pages that are sent to client
- *Locks* are taken by *client*
    - client can lock pages according to given permit

## Shared Virtual Memory

- Lazy call-back mechanism for permits
- Server maintains table of permits for each client
- When client requests page from server
    - Server checks for other clients with permit for page (and permit type)
    - Server issues call-back if one or more clients have conflicting permits

## Page Permits and Locks

- Lock for client (locally)
- Permission for server (globally)
- Read permit
    - client can lock page for reading *without consulting server*
    - many clients can hold a read permit for the same page
- Write permit
    - client can lock page for reading or writing *without asking server*
    - only one client can hold a write permit for a page at any given time
- Cache manager inspects permit and lock status for call-back
    - ✓: Positive
    - ✗: Negative, but permit is flagged to be revoked at transaction end


| Permit    | Lock     | Response                             |
|-----------|----------|--------------------------------------|
| read      | read     | ✗ server only calls back permit of other client needs to write |
| read      | no lock  | ✓                                    |
| write     | read     | ✓ permit for page downgraded to read |
| write     | write    | ✗                                    |
| write     | no lock  | ✓                                    |


- Pages on server are fetched with permission (read or write)
- Local locks don't tell server about lock/un-lock about after transaction


## Distribution and Heterogeneity

- Clients can access objects in different remote DBs in one transaction
- Clients and servers can run on different platforms
    - Win
    - Linux
    - Unix
    - ...
- Physical object layout is transformed automatically
    - by client
    - at run-time
    - when page is mapped into cache

## Persistence

- persistence by instantiation in C++
- Overloaded persistent `new` operator
- Several options for object allocation
    - transiently on the heap
    - DB
    - segment
    - cluster
    - ...
- Persistence is orthogonal to the type of an object (data-type orthogonality)

## Transactions

- Basic ACID properties
- Atomicity
    - after commit: guaranteed that data was written and is recoverable
    - after abort: changes are undone
- Consistency
    - it's impossible to apply or lose update while data is written
- Isolation
    - serialisability (CPSR) is guaranteed by 2-phase locking
    - MVCC provides serialisability for read-only transactions (using snapshots)
- Durability
    - changes are written to transaction log first
    - background process propagates changes to DB

### Transaction Types

- Read or Write
- Local or Global
    - local: only initiating thread is allowed
    - global: allows all threads in a session to share transaction
- Lexical or Dynamic transactions
    - Lexical transactions
        - automatically retry on lock
        - must start and end in same code block
        - always thread-local
    - Dynamic transactions
        - lower level of `os_transaction`class
        - better suited for multi-threaded applications

## Database Layout

- Memory pages held in hierarchy of clusters in segments
- Segments
    - logical partitioning of objects
    - Segment 0: schema segment
        - DB schema
        - DB roots
    - Segment 2: default segment
    - Segment 4: first user-created segment
    - max $2^{32}$ segments per DB
- Clusters
    - group closely related objects
    - each segment has default cluster 0
    - max $2^{31}$ clusters per segment

## Developing Applications (API)

- ObjectStore libraries
    - `objectstore`: run-time
    - `os_database`: DB management
    - `os_transactions`: transaction handles and functionality
    - `os_typespec`: determine type specification
    - `os_database_root`: manage roots
    - `os_segment`: segment access and management
    - `os_cluster`: cluster access and management

- Development process
    - writing persistent classes, schema file, app logic
    - compile schema file with `pssq` compiler
    - compile classes with C++ compiler
    - linking

### Managing Databases

- provided by `os_database`
    - `create()`: creates new DB
    - `open()`: opens DB
    - `save()`: saves DB, changes permanent
    - `close()`: closes DB, but doesn't save stat
    - `destroy()`: deletes DB

### Transactions

- provided by `os_transaction`
    - all interactions with DB must be in a transactions
    - can be nested
- defining and working with transactions
    - directly using `os_transaction` class (dynamic)
    - using macros (lexical)

### Creating Persistent Objects

Use overloaded `new` operator:
    :::cpp
    os_database *db = os_database::open("publications.db", 0, 1);
    Author *scheel = new(db, os_ts<Author>::get()) Author("Matthias Geel");
    db->close();

It's also possible to instantiate persistent array of objects.

### Updating and Deleting Persistent Objects

- Changes to persistent objects are propagated to DB automatically
    - when pages are sent back to server
    - client app updates memory-mapped persistent objects (using standard C++)
    - persistent objects are deleted when memory-mapped objects are deleted (using standard C++)
- Fully transparent to app developer

### Collections and Relationships

- Relationships between classes modeled as collections
- library of non-templated and templated collection types available
- traversal, manipulation, retrieval
- classes `os_collection`, `os_Collection<E>` and sub-classes

Relationships:

    :::cpp
    // Relationship to the customers orders:
    os_relationship_m_1(Customer,orders,Order,customer,os_List<Order*>) orders;


- Cursors over Collections
    - used to navigate and manipulate collections
    - class `os_Cursor`
    - cursors can be reused by rebinding to other collection

- Queries over Collections
    - specify
        - element type
        - query string
        - schema DB
    - query string indicates selection criterion
        - in C++
        - or pattern matching expression
    - function calls in query strings restricted to basic types
    - nested queries supported

## Database Roots

- persistent objects with a well-known name
- class `os_database_root`
    - root name as `char *`
    - pointer to object as `void *`

    - task splitter
    - multiple query server scanning portions of data in parallel
- Client-side Objectivity Kernel

## Federation

> Federation > Database > Container > Objects

- A *Federation* contains several *DBs*.
- A *DB* contains several *Containers*.
- A *Container* contains several *Objects*.

| Logical     | Physical  |
|-------------|-----------|
| Federation  | File      |
| Database    | Files     |
| Container   | Pages     |
| Objects     | Slots     |

- Federated DB contains one or more DBs
- A DB file can be copied to other machine

## Databases

- Databases are files
    - contain objects in container
    - up to 65530 databases per federation
    - a database holds up to 65530 containers
- can be moved or copied to any disk/machine
- can be marked read-only or taken off-line

## Containers

- Collections of objects in DB
    - contained objects can be of any size or type
    - can grow up to 65530 pages
- Useful for logical partitions
    - by owner
    - by attribute
    - by time
    - ...

## Pages

- Logical and Physical
    - logical page is permament part of object ID (OID)
    - physical page is where the page is put in the file
- Different age sizes possible
- Unit of transfer from disk or server
- Unit of locking
    - one writer
    - multiple readers

### Logical and Physical Pages

- When page is modified
    - new page is written to container
    - old page is kept
    - journal file is written
        - containing current page map
- When a transaction commits
    - page map is updated and written to disk
    - old page is freed (for reuse)
    - journal file is truncated
    - lock removed on lock server
- If a transaction aborts
    - new page is freed (for reuse)
    - lock is removed from server

## Persistent Object Model

- Language independent
- Persistence by inheritance
- Base types
    - numeric: sbyte, short, int, long, byte, ushort, uint, ulong, float, double
    - string: ASCII (8-bit), UTF8, UTF16
    - boolean
    - date/time
- Complex types
    - embedded: stored as part of parent object
    - referece: parent object stores object identifier
    - enumeration
    - arrays (fixed and variable-length)
- Relationships
- Collections

## Relationships

- between objects declared in classes
    - unary and binary
    - to-one and to-many
- Storage and management of relationships
    - inline
    - non-inline
    - binary associations represented as separate construct internally
- Consistency of relationships
    - referential integrity
    - inverse relationship of binary relationship is updated automatically
    - objects are removed from all relationships when deleted


### Non-Inline Relationships (default)

- Each object with relationships has a default relationship array
    - all non-inline relationships are stored in that array
- Each relationship in the array is identified by
    - relationship name (id, not string)
    - object id (ODI) of related object
- Objectivity traverses relationships until it locates the desired relationship
- array is like part of an adjacent matrix

### Inline Relationships

- To-one inline relationships: embedded as fields of an object
- To-many inline relationships: placed in their own array

## Deletion and Lock Propagation

- Relationshis can have semantics
- Deletion propagation
    - if object is deleted all associated objects are deleted
- Lock propagation
    - if object is locked all associated objects are locked
- Developer specifies operation and direction of propagation

## Copy and Versioning Behaviour

- Policies define what happens to object relationships when a copy or a new version of an object is made
    - copy: old an new object associated with same objects
    - drop: only old object is associated with other objects
    - move: only new object is associated with other objects

## Domain Classes

- .NET partial classes to separate app and persistence code
- Persistence by inheritance
    - both partial classes inherit form `ReferenceableObject`
- Persistence code class
    - defines schema class and attributes
    - functionality to create and dispose objects
    - properties for attributes defined by schema
    - proxy cache for each relationship
    - helper and utility functionality
- App code class contains user-defined code

## Connection, Sessions and Threads

- Static funtions for startup, shutdown and connection
- One connection to federation per application process
- Seesions
    - manage resources (cache, transaction state ...)
    - one or many per thread or
    - one shared by many threads
- Cache
    - remains intact through commits and checkpoints
    - flushed if transaction aborted

## Persistent Collections

- Built-in persistent collections: sets, lists and maps
    - automatically persistent (when created)
    - conform to `System.Collections.Generic` interface
- Types of persistent collections
    - ordered vs. unordered
    - scalable vs.non-scalabse

## Iterators

- Iterators are transient
    - provide access to persistent objects
- Predicates can be supplied to iterators
    - no (or less) `if`s in loop
- Not an efficient method for looking up objects
    - predicates evaluated on client (unless index is available)
    - can be improved with indexes and scoping
- Result is not built entirely before it is returned
    - clients can start process result (instead of getting blockes)
    - sorting of result is not possible

## Scope Names

- Generalization of DB roots
- Unique name
- Possible on each storage level
    - container
    - database
    - federation

## Retrieving Objects

-Scope names
- Creating links (and following them)
- Individual and group lookup
    - keys
    - iteratos
- Parallel query
    - Parallel Query Engine
    - divides query among several servers
- Content-based filtering
    - predicate-query language
    - used to follow to-many relationships
    - used in parallel queries

## LINQ Overview

- Part of .NEW (`System.Linq`)
- add native query capabilities to .NET languages
- Standard query operators defined by class `Enumerable`
- Language extensions are translated into method calls
- Static safety

# Graph Databases

- Domain specific solution
    - for a group of problems
    - a kind of solution for a kind of problems
- Technology models (describe the world):
    1. Key-Value Map
    2. Relational Model
    3. OO Model
- Mapping between models
- There is no generic model for all domains

## Social Network Analysis
- People are connected to each other
- Networks may be represented as graphs
    - Nodes: peoples
    - Edges: relationships
- [Social Network Analysis](http://www.orgnet.com/sna.html) to gather information

## Graphs
- Nodes and Edges may have attributes
    - Often key-value pairs
- Graph algorithms can compute different values
- Connections vary:
    - Uni- / Bidirectional connections
    - Nodes with single / multiple connections
    - Multiple connections with different attribute
    - Explicit / implicit connections
    - Transient / long lasting connections
    - One-time / repeated connections
        - regular / irregular connections

### Graph Metrics

#### Path Lengths

- [Dunbar's number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number)
- [Erdős number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number)
- [Bacon’s number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon)
- [Small world phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-world_experiment)

#### Node Properties

- Degree Centrality
    - The number of direct connections a node has
- Betweenness Centrality (Bridge)
    - A node is *between* two important nodes
    - has great influence what flows in the network
- Closeness Centrality
    - A node has the shortest path to all others
    - good position to monitor information flow in network

#### Network Structure Properties

- Network Centralization
    - Dominated by one or few nodes
    - (single) point of failure
- Density/Cohesion
    - Proposition of direct connections relative to all possible connections
- Distance (Small World)
    - Minimum numbers of edges needed to connect two particular nodes
- Clustering Coefficients
    - Likelihood that two associates of a node are also associates to each other
    - 'cliquishness'

### General Model

- Common representation
- Uniform graph representation
    - needed to apply algorithms
- Always *2* core *identities* connected by *action*
- e.g.
    - connect 2 authors that worked on same publication
    - or connect publications that have the same author

## Graph Database Implementations

- API
- Support for CRUD
- High-level operations for graph traversals
- Sometimes graph algorithms part of DB
- ACID

    - Path Guide (path to go next)
    - Path Qualifier (terminate current path?)
    - Result Qualifier (put path in result set?)
    - Result handler is called after navigation on result set

# Version Models

- Various models proposed
    - temporal DBs
    - CAD/CAM
    - SW configuration and engineering environments
- Some object-oriented DBs provide versioning



Comparison:

- Version Control Systems: unstructured data
- Versioning DBs: structured data

## Versioned Object

- Concept with number of states
- Different levels of granularity
    - entire files
    - tuples of relation
    - attributes of a class
    - objects in OOP system
- Each version is a possible representation of the object
    - corresponding directly to one of its states


## Version Organsiations

- Relations between version
    - not related (set)
    - linerar versioning (time, list)
    - trees (branches)
    - DAG (merging)

## References

- Specific reference
    - references single version of object directly
- Generic reference
    - references entire object
    - has to be dereferenced to a version when traversed
- default version
    - it's not always clear which version is the default one (e.g. DAG)

## Storage Strategies

- Representing versions at physical level
    - store complete versions of objects
    - store changes (deltas) between versions
- Delta-based approaches
    - forward or backward deltas
    - state-based or operation-based delta
- Different strategies have different perfomance
    - storage vs. retrieval
    - space vs. time
    - ...

## Operation and Interaction Models

- Operations
    - Control evolution of versions (of single objects)
    - create new version
    - branch a parallel version
    - merge two parallel versions
    - delete a version
- Interaction or transactions models
    - working with complex objects and object graphs
    - automatic versioning transparent to user
    - library model uses check-out and check-in operations
    - long running and nested transactions

## Queries and Configurations

- additional constraint to seletc correct representations (versions)
- various implementations
    - configurator evaluates rules against versioned objects
    - declarative queries express constraints in extended language
    - logical (based on feature logic)
- Dereferencing of generic references
    - query evaluator needs to select specific version
    - access for parallel versions
    - access for sequencial versions


## Temporal Databases

- one of the first application domains for version models
- manage different time-dependent data
- field of research
- numerous approaches
- mostly based on relational DBs

## Time in Databases

- does time stored in a DB represent
    - time in the domain (e.g. event schedule)?
    - time of DB operation (e.g. insertion, update)?
    - can the time be *arbitrary modified*?
    - is the time value provided by app or DB?
    - ...
- different types of time to characterise temporal data
    - Transaction, Registration or Physical time
        - transaction or registration time
        - captures when values were stored in DB
        - `AS-OF` operation
    - Valid or logical time
        - real-world time
        - used to express when values existed in *real world*
        - `WHEN` operation
    - Bitemporal: combination of physical and logical time
    - User-defined time
        - all other aspects of time

## Classification of Temporal Databases

- Static or snapshot DB
    - conventional DB
    - does not manage temporal data
    - supports only one single version
    - if value is updated, previous value is lost
- Static roll-back DB
    - like version control system (more or less)
    - changes can be made only on actual version
        - errors in older versions can't be fixed
    - keeps track of transaction time
    - supports `AS-OF` operation
    - no way to correct an error
    - space or computation overhead (destructive vs. non-destructive)
- Historical DB
    - keeps track of *valid time*
    - supports `WHEN`
    - changes can be made to previous values
- Temporal DB
    - bi-temporal
    - keept track of *transaction* and *valid* time
    - supports `AS-OF` and `WHEN` operations
- Spatio-Temporal DB
    - DB for moving objects
    - continuous update of location
    - uncertainty of location value

### Querying Moving Objects with Uncertainity

- Point Queries
    - operators over singel trajectory
        - `Where_At(trajectory T, time t)`: expected location on route `T` at time `t`
        - `When_At(trajectory T, location l)`: times object expected to be at location `l` on `T`
- Spatio-Temporal Range Queries
    - set of *6 boolean predicates*
    - give *qualitative* description of relative position

- location changes continuously: condition satisfied *sometime* or *always* within $[t_b,t_e]
- due to uncerainty: condition satisfied *possibly* or *definitely* at point $p \in [t_b,t_e]

- *possibly*: trajectory with uncretainity
- *sometime*: don't care about time

Leads to 8 possible operators


1. `Possibly_Sometime_Inside( T, R, tb te)`
2. `Sometime_Possibly_Inside ( T, R, tb, te)`
3. `Possibly_Always_Inside( T, R, tb, te)`
4. `Always_Possibly_Inside( T, R, tb, te)`
5. `Definitely_Always_Inside( T, R, tb, te)`
6. `Always_Definitely_Inside( T, R, tb, te)`
7. `Definitely_Sometime_Inside( T, R, tb, te)`
8. `Sometime_Definitely_Inside( T, R, tb, te)`

Some of them are semantically equivalent

## Representing Temporal Data

- Tuple Versioning
    - tuple is extended with attribute for temporal dimension
    - can be realised without violating *relational first normal form*

Example:

| Employee   | Office | Salary | TS   | TE   |
|------------|--------|--------|------|------|
| Anne       | A12    | 5500   | 2000 | now  |
| Bob        | B 34   | 4000   | 2002 | 2003 |
| Bob        | B 34   | 5500   | 2003 | now  |
| Charles    | C 56   | 6700   | 1995 | 2000 |
| Charles    | C 56   | 7500   | 2000 | 2006 |
| Charles    | C 56   | 7000   | 2006 | now  |
| Denise     | B 34   | 3000   | 1990 | 1995 |
| Denise     | B 34   | 5300   | 1995 | 2002 |

- Attribute Versioning
    - each attribute is extended with temporal information
    - requires non-first normal form $NF^3$ relational systems

Example:

| Employee | Office | Salary            |
|----------|--------|-------------------|
| Anne     | A12    | (5500, 2000, now) |
| Bob      | B 34   | (4000, 2002, 2003) (5500, 2003, now) |
| Charles  | C 56   | (6700, 1995, 2000) (7500, 2000, 2006) (7000, 2006, now) |
| Denise   | B 34   | (3000, 1990, 1995) (5300, 1995, 2002) |


## Conceptual and Data Models

- Early models: extend relational of E/R model
- Bitemporal Conceptual Data Model (BCDM)
    - tuple versioning
    - using *4* additional columns per tuple
    - *transation time* and *valid time*
        - special 'until changed' and 'now' values indicate if a tuple is current
    - query language TSQL2
        - extension of SQL
        - introduces `VALIDTIME` and `WHEN` clause
        - integrated into SQL3 as SQL/Temporal

## Homogeneous and Heterogenous Models

- homogenous if temporal domain does not vary from one attribute to another
    - all models that use tuple versioning are homogenous
- heterogenous if attributes of a tuple associated to different times

## Storage Models

- Temporal relation as 3-dimensional data structure
    - sequence of relations
    - data cube
- implemented using a two level store structure
    - primary store contains current versions
        - satisfy all non-temporal queries
    - history store hold in remaining history versions
- traditional access methods cannot be used in such a storage model
- Two-level Storage Structures
    - Reverse Chaining
    - Accession Lists
    - Clustering
    - Stacked Versions

## Engineering Databases

- Engineering application domains
    - Computer-Aided Design (CAD)
    - Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM)
- support development and maintenance of products
- Requirements
    - data structures
    - concurrency control concepts
    - define and manage complex (and hierarchical) design objects
    - versionen support for complex objects
    - iterative development
    - alternatives and trial-and-error experiments
- 2-dimensional version models
    - linear revision dimension
    - non-sequential variation dimension

## Design Space Version Model

- Modeling primitives
- component hierarchies (*is-a-part-of*)
- version histories (*is-a-kind-of*, *is-derved-from*)
- configurations combine hierarchies and version histories

## Software Configuration Systems

- Developed for SW development
- SW Configuration Management (SCM)
- SW Engineering Environments (SEE)
- manage product directly
- fully automting process of building final product
- built around source files and program modules
- reference and dependencies management complex
    - hidden inside source code files

## Product Space Representation

- Data model with type relationships
    - composition tree with files as leaves
    - dependencies are sepresented within tree
    - build information can be computed from composition and dependency relationships
- Without spanning tree
    - all files of one module are summarised as one object
    - only source dependencies are represented
    - directly corresponds to logical structure

## Version Space

- Version model defines how objects are versioned
    - versioned object is container for set of object version
    - common properties shared by all versions (invariants)
    - differences (deltas) between versions
        - symmetric deltas
        - directed deltas (changes)
- Definition of version set
    - *extentional* versioning enumerates all member of version set
    - *intentional* versioning uses predicate defining version set members
- Evolution
    - revisions: track of history
    - variants: alternatives
    - can be used for cooperation and collaboration

### Version Space Representation

- One-level representation
    - Successor relationship (Sequence)
    - Branch (Tree) and Merge (DAG)
- Two-level representation
    - Revision
    - Variants

# Indexing

Make OODBs faster and more performant

- Compare OOP model to Relational model

Main differences between OOP and Relational model:

1. inheritance (is-a)
2. multitype attributes (sets, collections)
    - First normal form in Relational Databases disallows mutlivalued attributes (collections) in a field
3. dereferencing a path of pointers/references (traversing the object graph)

> OODB systems can be faster when using additional information that a RDBMSs doesn't have

Different approaches to:

- Mapping (ORM)
- Physically represent data differently (eg. Objectivity)
- Use additional (meta-) data but keep the representation of the data
    - secondary datastructures
    - index structures
- Group record: pages, clusters ...


## Type Hierarchy Indexing

### Key- vs Type-Grouping

- Key-Grouping
    - build index along the actual attribute value
    - as $B^+$-trees
    - additional information about typing and sub-typing in the leafs
- Type-Grouping
    - index built along typing information
    - values are secondary datastructure


### Extent and Full Extent

- Extent: all objects of a given class (without sub-classes)
- Full Extent: all objects of a given class and it's sub-classes


### Single Class Index (SC-Index)

- Index construction for attribute of a type *t*
    - incorporate only direct instances of a particular type in index
    - construct search structure for all types in sub-hierarchy of t
    - search data structures (called *SC-Index components*)
    - Evaluator needs to traverse all components referenced by query
- Usually implemented using $B^+$-trees
- Type-Grouping

### Class Hierarchy Index (CH-Index)

- One search structure for all objects of all types of indexed hierarchy
- One index on the common attribute for all classes of a inheritance graph
- Leaf node consists of
    - key-value
    - key directory
        - contains an entry for each class that has instances with the key-value in the indexed attribute
        - entry for a class consist of class identifier and offset for list of OIDs in index record
    - number of elements in list of OIDs (for each class in the inheritance graph)
    - list of OIDs
- Evaluator scans through $B^+$-tree once
    - selects OIDs f types referenced by query
    - discards other OIDs
- Point queries perform good
- Range queries depend on number of referenced types
    - good when queries aim at indexed type and all sub-types
    - bad if only few types of indexed hierarchy hit by query
- Key-grouping structure


### H-Tree

- Set of nested $B^+$-trees
- Combining class hierarchy with SC-Index
- Nesting reflects indexed type hierarchy
    - each H-tree component is nested with H-trees of immediate sub-types
    - H-tree index for attribute of inheritance sub-graph is H-tree hierarchy nested according to super-type-sub-type relation
- Avoids full scans of each B-tree component when several types queried
- Single type look-up: don't search nested trees
- Type hierarchy look-up: traverse nested trees

- Type-grouping structure

### Class Division Index (CD-Index)

- Compromise between
    - indexing for each type
    - indexing extent for each type
- Specific family of type sets for indexed hierarchy
- Look at all possible combinations of full extends for all types
- Combine parts of sub-type hierarchies to use one index structure (like SC-index)
- Each typeset managed with search data structure
- Parameters *q* and *r* give bounds
    - *q*: number of index structures needed to build a type extent
    - *r*: number of times a type set is managed redundantly or replicated
    - big *q*: slow queries
    - big *r*: slow updates
- Multiple index structures need to be accessed for a query
    - trade-off between:
        - number of index structures to access for a query
        - number of index structures to maintain
- Type-grouping structure

### Multi-Key Type Index (MT-Index)

- *Multi-Dimensional* indexing (locality)
- Type information as additional attribute available
- Compromise between
    - type grouping
    - key grouping
- Type membership as additional object attribute
    - symmetrical indexing of object types and attributes
    - indexing of more than one attribute with single search structure
- Linearization
- Key-grouping structure (type is handled as an attribute)


## Aggregation Path Indexing

- Backward queries
    - without full object tree traverses
- Forward queries
    - without retrieving intermediate objects
    - less hops to get to objects referenced over seversl levels
    - shortcut forward

### Nested Index (NX)

- Direct association between
    - an *ending* object and
    - corresponding starting objects along a path
- Bypassing intermediate objects
- Only allows backwards traversals of full path
- Equivalent to backward traversal in ASR canonical
- A Nested Index *NX(P)* for path *P* with length *1* is equivalent to a Multi-Index *MX(P)* for the same path
- Updating index structure is expensive

![Nested Index](/images/object_databases/nested_index.png)

### Path Index (PX)

- Records all sub-paths leading to an ending object
- Predicates can be evaluated on all classes along the path
- Equivalent to backwards traversal of right-complete ASR
- A Path-Index *PX(P)* for path *P* with length *1* is equivalent to Multi-Index *MX(P)* an a Nested Index *NX(P)* for the same path
- Updating index structure better than with *NX*

![Path Index](/images/object_databases/path_index.png)

### Join-Index (JX)

- Originally for optimization of *joins* in Relational DBs
- Consists of a set of binary join indexes (Slides p. 33)
- Forward references are also indexed
- Cost compared to *MX* doubled

### Multi-Index (MX)

- Like Join-Indexes in Relational DBs
- Divide path (of arbitrary length) into sub-paths
    - sub-paths have length *1*
    - index maintained over sub-paths
- Query evaluation
    - concatenating *n* index edges requires *n* index scans
    - supports backward traversals and queries
    - *no* forward traversals and queries
- Each index enty is represented as a pair
    1. A key-value
    2. set of OIDs of objects holding this key-value (for indexed attribute)
- Updates cheap
- Complex queries expensive (hop over nodes)
- each reference in object has index structure for backward references

![Multi Index](/images/object_databases/multi_index.png)

### Access Support Relations (ASR)

- Given a path create *4* index structures that support all desired queries (Nested Index, Path Index, Multi-Index)
    1. Canonical representation
    2. Full representation
    3. Left representation
    4. Right representation
    - Related to Relational DB Joins: canonical is like regular join in SQL
- ASR Compositions Index Graph
    - Queries that do not traverse the path at either endpoint can't be answered efficiently
    - Aggregation path can be split in sub-paths (partitions)
    - Set of partions: decompositions of an ASR

### Overview: Aggregation Path Indexing

- Nested Index and Path Index implemented using
    - trees or
    - hash tables

## Collection Operations

- For: sets, bags, lists, arrays
- new modelling features, enhanced expressiveness
- increased complexity of indexing and query optimisation
- OQL provides constructors and operators for collections

### Signature Files

- Index construction for a multi-valued property of a type
- Query over multi-valued properties
- Compute signatures for attribute values, elements ...
- Use mathematical operation
    - Super-set, sub-set ...
    - 'actual drop': true positive
    - 'false drop': false positive

# The OM Data Model

- Extended Entity-Relationship model
- for OOP data management
- special features
    - difference between typing and classification
    - types (model):
        - names
        - attributes
        - behaviour
        - relationships
    - objects: attributes and methods
    - multiple inheritance, multiple instantiation (gain/lose roles), multiple classification
    - collections as first-class concepts
    - binary associations as first-class concepts
    - constraints for integrity, classification and evolution
    - data definition, manipulation and query language (OML)

## Typing and Classification

| Typing                        | Classification               |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
| static                        | dynamic                      |
| representation of entities    | roles of entities            |
| defines format of data values | defines semantic groupings as collections of values |
| defines operations            | defines constraits among collection |
| defines inheritance properties | Collections: member type    |
| 'Java' classes                |                              |
| multiple inheritance/instantiation  |                        |


- better understanding of issues
    - important to recognise the two concepts
- Reduces complexity of type graphs
    - no need to introduce subtypes to represent each classification
- Rich classification structures
- Support for relationships between objects
    - accociation over collections instead embedded in objects
- Integration of:
    - Database
    - Programming Languages
- Collections
    - semantic groupings of objects
- Member types of collections
    - constrain membership in a collection
    - can define a *view* of object accessed in *context* of collection
- Object evolution
    - objects can gain/loose roles by being added or deleted form collections
    - type change not always required (???) <!-- slides week 13 p.7 -->

## OM Data Model Layers

- OM distinguishes
    - typing from
    - classification
- Type-layer
    - object representation
        - objects: type units
        - can gain and lose types dynamically: dressing and stripping
    - multiple inheritance
    - multiple instantiation
        - objects can have types from parallel inheritance hierarchies
        - objects can have types that are completely unrelated
- Classification-layer
    - based on types from type layer
    - semantic groupings: collections
        - membership constrained by type
        - associations to link objects together
        - kinds and roles
        - constraints
            - subcollections and supercollections
            - cardinality to describe associations
            - evolution constraints
            - ...
    - multiple classification
    - collections and associations
- Associations can be nested
    - model n-ary relationships
    - clearer semantics
    - allow uniform query language

- Things that exist
    - types
    - values for attributes
- Collection is not just contains objects
    - relationship to objects
    - name
    - constraint (subset relation)
        - joint
        - disjoint
    - associations
        - collection to pairs

- e.g: A person becomming a friend or an enemy doesn't change (or add/remove) any properties of a person type
- Objects can gain state and behavior dynamically
    - distinguish
        - object: can refer to, identity, can be pointed to
        - instance: container of values of a particular type

- Relationships
- intentional / extensional

- Query
    - Decide if something in a collection or not
    - Traversing result (iterator, cursor)
- SQL
    - relationships mapped by primary-/foreign-key
    - `select` can be used instead of `joins` to follow relationships
    - A selection query is fully specified when:
        - providing a *set of candidates* and
        - a function that takes *individual candidates* and returns *true* or *false*
- OM Model queries
    - Declaritive query language
    - Collections are *sets of candidates* for queries
- Map-Reduce

## Collection Constraint

- Disjoint: XOR
- Cover: OR
- Partition: one and only one needs to be true

## Associations (Relationships)

- binary relation between 2 collections
- cardinality
- tuple as type of collection
- can be nested: n-ary relationships

## Object Model Language (OML)

- Declarative OOP language for OM data model
- OML Data Definition Language
    - object and structured type definition
    - method definition and emplementation
    - collection, association and constraint definition
- OML Data Manipulation Language
    - creating and updating objects
    - ceate, update, delete, dress and strip operations
- OML Query Language
    - expressions and functions for values of base types
    - operations on objects
        - access attributes
        - invoke methods
    - operations on collections (collection algebra)
- map-reduce
    - very important operations after selection

### Collection Algebra

- Operations defined for collections of OM model
    - union
    - intersections
    - difference
    - selection
    - map
        - takes a set of objects and applies a function on *each object*
        - the result set has the same carinality
    - reduce
        - take a set of values (objects)
        - return one value (object)
    - flatten
- Sematics of operations depend on collection behaviour
    - set theory defines semantics
    - generalisation for *bag*, *sequence* and *ranking*
    - mixing and converting collection types

### Binary Collections

- All collections-operations can be applied to binary collection
- Binary collections suort additional operations
    - domain and range
        - not same as collection with tuple containing 'range' and 'domain'
    - domain and range restriction (selection)
    - subtraction
    - inverse
        - swapping domain and range
    - nest
        - grouping of binary collections
    - compose
        - find associatd objects in DB it may be necessary to compose (*join*) associations
    - closure
        - repeatedly compose binary collection with itself
    - division
        - divide a binary collection with a unary collection

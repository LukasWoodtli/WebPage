This page collects my notes about the Cortex-M3 architecture.
In particular I use the *EFM32TG840F32* processor on a STK3300 starter kit by
[Silicon Labs](https://www.silabs.com/).

Most information on this page is taken from the
[documentation by ARM](http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.subset.cortexm.m3/index.html).

# Registers

All registers are 32-bit wide.

| Register   | Use                                  |
|------------|--------------------------------------|
| R0 - R12   | General Purpose Registers            |
| R13        | Stack Pointers (SP_main, SP_process) |
| R14        | Link Register (LR)                   |
| R15        | Program Counter (PC)                 |

## General Purpose Registers

Some 16-bit Thumb instruction can only access R0 - R7.

The reset values of R0 - R12 are random.

## Stack Pointers (SP, R13, MSP, PSP)
The  Cortex-M3  contains  two  stack  pointers:

- Main Stack Pointer (SP_main): The default stack pointer, used by the operating system and exception handlers
- Process Stack Pointer (SP_process): Used by application code

In thread mode CONTROL bit[1] indicates the used stack pointed:

- 0: MSP
- 1: PSP

The two Stack Pointers are banked. Only one is visible at a time through R13.

The lowest 2 bits of the stack pointers are always 0. So they are always word aligned.

It's not necessary to use both stack pointers (SP_main and SP_process). Simple applications use only SP_main.

PUSH and POP work with the actual *SP* (R13). The stack is 32-bit aligned.

    :::nasm
    PUSH {R3}  ; R13 = R13-4, memory[R13] = R3
    POP {R3}   ; R3 = memory[R13], R13 = R13+4

It's also possible to to push and pop multiple registers in one instruction.

    :::nasm
    my_function
        PUSH {R0-R3, R3, R7} ; Save registers
        ...
        POP {R0-R3, R3, R7}  ; Restore registers
        BX R7                ; Return to caller

It's possible to use *SP* instead of *R13* for accessing the actual Stack Pointer.
For accessing a particular Stack Pointer the mnemonic MSP (for SP_main) or PSP (for SP_process) exist.

## Link Register (R14, LR)

The Link Register contains the return address of a subroutine/function.
On function entry (BL) the return address is automatically saved on LR.

    :::nasm
    main
       BL my_func; call funct. with branch and link. PC=my_func, LR=next instr in main

    ...

    my_func
        ...
        BX LR ; return to address in LR


## Program Counter (R15, PC)

This register holds the current program position.

It can be written to for controlling the program flow (jumps). But then *LR* is not updated.

Since the Cortex-M3 has a pipelined architecture the PC can be ahead of the actual executed
instruction (normally by 4).

On reset, the processor loads the PC with the value of the reset vector, which is at address 0x00000004.

> The least-significant bit of each address loaded into *PC* (with `BX`, `BLX`, `LDM`, `LDR`, or `POP`)
> must be 1 (indicating thumb mode).
>
> Otherwise an exception will occur on the Cortex-M3.

## Program Status Registers

The special-purpose program status registers (*xPSR*) provide arithmetic and logic flags (zero and carry flag),
execution status and current executing IRQ number.


| Bit   | APSR    |  IPSR            | EPSR   |
|------:|:-------:|:----------------:|:------:|
| 31    |  N      |   -              |  -     |
| 30    |  Z      |   -              |  -     |
| 29    |  C      |   -              |  -     |
| 28    |  V      |   -              |  -     |
| 27    |  Q      |   -              |  -     |
| 25-26 |  -      |   -              | ICI/IT |
| 24    |  -      |   -              |   T    |
| 20-23 |  -      |   -              |   -    |
| 16-19 | GE[3:0] |   -              |   -    |
| 9-15  |  -      |   -              | ICI/IT |
| 0-8   |  -      | Exception Number |   -    |


### Application Program Status Register (APSR)

Flags that can be set by application code (unprivileged mode).

- **N (bit[31])**: Negative condition flag. Set if result of instruction is negative.
- **Z (bit[30])**: Zero condition flag. Set if result of instruction is zero (0).
- **C (bit[29])**: Carry (or borrow) condition flag. Set if instruction results in a carry condition (i.e unsigned overflow on addition)
- **V (bit[28])**: Overflow condition flag. Set if the instruction results in a an overflow condition (i.e. signed overflow on addition)
- **Q (bit[27])**: Set if a `SSAT` or `USAT` instruction changes the input value for the signed/unsigned range of the result (saturation).
- **GE[3:0] (bits[19:16])**: DSP extension only. Otherwise reserved.

### Interrupt Program Status Register (IPSR)

- Handler Mode: This register holds the exception number of the exception that is currently processed.
- Thread Mode: If no exception is processed the value is zero (0).

### Execution Program Status Register (EPSR)

- **T bit[24]**: Defines the instruction set. The Cortex-M3 supports only Thumb-2. So it must be 0. An fault is caused if this bit is set to 0.
- **ICI/IT**: TBD

### Composite views of the xPSR registers

The commands `MSR` and `MRS` can use the mnemonics APSR, IPSR, and EPSR directly or combined mnemonics for the Program Status Registers.

| Mnemonic| Registers                  |
|---------|----------------------------|
| IAPSR   | IPSR and APSR              |
| EAPSR   | EPSR and APSR              |
| IEPSR   | IPSR and EPSR              |
|  PSR    | All three xPSR registers   |


## Special-Purpose Mask Registers

This registers are set to 0 at reset.

They can only be written if in privileged level.

- *PRIMASK*: Disable interrupts except nonmaskable interrupt (NMI) and hard fault.
- *FAULTMASK*: Disable interrupts except nonmaskable interrupt (NMI).
- *BASEPRI*: Disable interrupts of given priority level or lower priority level.

## Control Register

Define privileged status and select stack pointer.

### Control bit[0] (nPRIV, privilege level)
This bit has only a meaning in thread mode.

- 0: Privileged Level
- 1: Unprivileged (user) Level

In handler mode the processor operates in privileged mode.

This bit is only writable with privileged level.

### Control bit[1] (SPSEL, stack selection)

This bit makes only sense in thread mode.

- 0: Use SP_process
- 1: Use SP_main

In handler mode this bit must be 0 (SP_main is used).

This bit is only writable if in thread mode with privileged level.

### Switching Privilege Level

To switch from privileged level to user level the *Control bit[0]* can be written directly.

The switch from user level to privilege level heeds to be performed within an exception handler.

## Reset Values and Required Access Privileges

| Name      | Read/Write | Required privilege | Reset value                   |
|-----------|------------|--------------------|-------------------------------|

# Modes

The Cortex-M3 has two modes:

- Thread Mode
- Handler Mode

In Thread Mode the processor can run in two privilege levels:

- User Level
- Privileged Level

In Handler Mode only the Privileged Level is available.

|                           | Application Code | Exception Handler |
|---------------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Unprivileged (user) Level | Thread Mode      |       -           |
| Privileged Level          | Thread Mode      | Handler Mode      |

![The ARM Cortex-M3 Modes and Levels](/images/arm_cortex_m3_modes_levels.svg)


# Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller (NVIC)

## Nested

All external and some system interrupts can be assigned to different priority levels. Current
handled interrupts can only be disrupted by interrupts of higher priority.

## Vectored

The addresses of the interrupt service routines (ISRs) are stored in a vector. If an interrupt
occurs the look-up of the routine is fast and the handling of the interrupt is not delayed by look-up
code.

## Dynamic Priority Setting

The priority of an interrupt can be changed at run time.

# Memory Layout

The Cortex-M3 has a defined memory map. So most built in peripherals are accessible by their
memory address. Thus it's easy to access it in C/C++ code.

| Address Range           | Use                  | Description                                          |
|-------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 0x00000000 - 0x1FFFFFFF | CODE                 | Program Code. Exception vector table after start up. |
| 0x20000000 - 0x3FFFFFFF | SRAM                 | Used as static RAM.                                  |
| 0x40000000 - 0x5FFFFFFF | Peripherals          | For integrated peripherals.                          |
| 0x60000000 - 0x9FFFFFFF | External RAM         | For external connected RAM.                          |
| 0xA0000000 - 0xDFFFFFFF | External Peripherals | For external connected peripherals.                  |
| 0xE0000000 - 0xFFFFFFFF | System               | NVIC, MPU, Debug...                                  |


## Bit-Banding

Bit-Banding is a feature that allows to access certain bits individually. The access to the bits are atomically.

The access to the individual bits are accomplished by mapping each bit from the bit-banding region to an address
in a region called bit-banding alias.

- Each bit-banding region is 1 MB big.
- The bit-banding alias regions are 32 MB big (but it addresses in total only the 1 MB of the bit-banding region).

There are two bit-band region. One for memory and the other for peripherals.

|                     | Bit-Band region         | Bit-Band alias region       |
|---------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Memory              | 0x20000000 - 0x200FFFFF | 0x22000000 - 0x23FFFFF      |
| Peripherals         | 0x40000000 - 0x400FFFFF | 0x42000000 - 0x43FFFFF      |


To access one bit through the bit-banding alias the mapping is performed by this code:

    :::c
    #define BIT_BANDING_ALIAS_OFFSET(byteOffsetInBitBandRegion, bitNumber)  ((byteOffsetInBitBandRegion * 32) + (bitNumber * 4))
    #define BIT_BANDING_MEMORY_ALIAS_BASE    0x22000000
    #define BIT_BANDING_PERIPERAL_ALIAS_BASE 0x42000000

    #define BIT_BANDING_MEMORY_TO_ALIAS(byte, bit)  (BIT_BANDING_MEMORY_ALIAS_BASE + BIT_BANDING_ALIAS_OFFSET(byte, bit))
    #define BIT_BANDING_PERIPHERAL_TO_ALIAS(byte, bit) (BIT_BANDING_PERIPHERAL_ALIAS_BASE + BIT_BANDING_ALIAS_OFFSET(byte, bit))

It's also possible to calculate the address in the other direction from the alias region to the bit-banding region.
But it's usually not nessecary to do the address translation in this direction.

Here is a small example:

    :::c
    // Set pI to point to the first 32-bit value in the memory bit-banding region
    volatile uint32_t * pI = (uint32_t *)(0x20000000);
    // Set the value where pI is pointing to 0
	*pI = 0;

    // Get the bit-banding alias address of bit 2 of the first byte in the bit-banding region
	volatile uint32_t * pIAlias = (uint32_t *)BIT_BANDING_MEMORY_TO_ALIAS(0, 2);
    // Seet this bit to one
	*pIAlias = 1;

    // *pI == 4. The bit two ot *pI is now set

# Bus Interfaces

The Cortex-M3 has multiple bus interfaces:

- Code Memory Bus: For fetching instructions from code memory.
- System Bus: For static RAM and peripherals.
- Private Peripheral Bus: For access to a part of the system memory and for debugging.



# Data Types

Following data types are supported in memory:

- Byte: 8 bits.
- Half-word: 16 bits.
- Word: 32 bits.

The registers are 32 bit wide. The instruction set supports following data types in the registers:

- 32-bit pointers.
- Unsigned and signed 32-bit integers.
- Unsigned 16-bit and 8-bit integers in zero-extended form.
- Signed 16-bit and 8-bit integers in sign-extended form.
- Unsigned and signed 64-bit integers held in two registers (limited direct support).

Signed data is represented using two's complement format.

# Exceptions


| Exception number  | Exception | Priority |
|-------------------|-----------|----------|
| 1                 | Reset     | -3       |
| 2                 | NMI       | -2       |
| 3                 | Hard Fault| -1       |
| 4                 | MemManage | configurable |
| 5                 | BusFault  | configurable |
| 6                 | UsageFault| configurable |
| 7 - 10            | Reserved  |   -          |
| 11                | SVCall    | configurable |
| 12                | DebugMonitor | configurable |
| 13                | Reserved  |   -           |
| 14                | PendSV    | configurable |
| 15                | SysTick   | configurable |
| 16 - 16+N         | External interrupt 0 .. N | configurable |


## Reset

There are two levels of reset:

- Power Reset: Resets processor, System Control Space and debug logic.
- Local Reset: Resets processor and System Control Space (except some fault and debug resources).

The exception can't be disabled.
Reset exception has a fixed priority of *-3*.

## Non Maskable Interrupt (NMI)
NMI is the highest priority exception after reset.

NMI can be generated by hardware or software can set the NMI exception to the Pending state.

It can't be disabled.
The fixed priority is *-2*.

## HardFault

HardFault is a generic exception. It usually means that the system is
not recoverable anymore. But in some cases it might be recoverable.

HardFault can't be disabled.
It has a fixed priority of *-1*.

## MemManage

MemManage indicates a violation of memory access protected by the MPU (Memory Protection Unit).
It can occur for data and instruction memory transactions.

This fault can be disabled by software. Then a MemManage escalates to a HardFault.

The priority can be configured.

## BusFault

This are memory faults other than MemManage faults. They can occur
for data and instruction transactions.
They can occur synchronous or asynchronous and arise usually by errors
on system buses.

This fault can be disabled by software. Then a BusFault escalates to a HardFault.

The priority can be configured.

## UsageFault

UsageFaults can have different causes:

- Undefined instruction.
- Invalid state when executing instruction.
- Error on exception return.
- Attempt to access co-processor when it's unavailable (or disabled).

The reporting of the following UsageFaults can be activated:

- Word/half-word access on unaligned memory address.
- Division by zero.

This fault can be disabled by software. Then a UsageFault escalates to a HardFault.

The priority can be configured.

## DebugMonitor

The DebugMonitor is a fault and it's a synchronous exception.
It occurs when halting debug is disabled and the DebugMonitor is enabled.

The priority is configurable.

> A debug watch-point is asynchronous and behaves as an interrupt.

## SVCall

This exception is used as supervisor calls it's caused by the instruction SVC.

It's permanently activated. The priority is configurable.

## Interrupts

The Cortex-M3 has two levels of system interrupts and up to 496 external interrupts (the EFM32TG has 23).

### System-Level Interrupts

#### PendSV

Used for system calls (Supervisor call) generated by software. An application uses a Supervisor call if it uses resources from the OS.

The Supervisor call caused by PendSV executes when the processor takes the PendSV interrupt.

> For a synchronous Supervisor call (with application code), software uses the SVC instruction. This generates an SVCall exception.

PendSV is permanently enabled, and is controlled using the ICSR.PENDSVSET and ICSR.PENDSVCLR bits.

#### SysTick
Generated by the SysTick Timer (integral part of Cortex-M3).

SysTick is permanently enabled, and is controlled using the ICSR.PENDSTSET and ICSR.PENDSTCLR bits.

> Software can suppress hardware generation of the SysTick event.

# The Vector Table

The Vector Table contains the reset value of *SP_main* and the addresses of each exception handler function.

| Offset in Table (32-bit words) | Description                  |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------|
| 0                              | Reset value of SP_main       |
| Exception Number               | Address of exception handler |

> The least-significant bit of each exception handler address (vector) must be 1, indicating that the exception handler is in Thumb code.

The position of the *Vector Table* is defined by the *Vector Table Offset Register (VTOR)*.

# Reset Sequence

At start up the *Vector Table* is located at memory position 0 (flash).
It can later be relocated to an other memory position by software.

After reset the processor does:

1. Set main Stack Pointer
    - Load 32-bit value from address 0x00000000
    - Save that value to *SP_main*
2. Run start up code
    - Read the next entry in the *Vector Table* (0x00000004, reset vector)
    - Jump to that address and start running code there

> Since the Cortex-M4 has a full descending stack the initial stack address
has to be 0x04 bigger the the beginning of the stack.


# Assembler

Most assembler examples use the [GCC Assembler (gas)](https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs-2.25/as/index.html).

## Addressing Modes

`addr`: Absolute addressing mode (memory address of operator is given directly).

`%Rn`: Register direct (the value given in the register is used as operator).

`[%Rn]`: Register indirect or indexed (the value given in the register is used as address to the operator).

`[%Rn,#n]`: Register based with offset (the address of the operand is calculated by the content of the register plus a constant).

`#imm`: Immediate data (the operator is given directly as a constant).

*Rn* can be any of the numbered registers.

## Suffixes

Some instructions can have suffixes.

### Write Flags Suffix

The Suffix `S` indicates that the instruction updates the flags (in *APSR*) according to the result.

For example `ADDS R0, R0, R1;` updates the flags.

### Conditional Suffixes

This suffixes can be used for branching instructions but also for conditional execution commands.

| Suffix            | Meaning                             | Tested Flags           |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------|

In the instruction examples `<c>` is used to indicate that one of the conditional
suffixes can be used.

## Instruction Width Qualifier

This assembler qualifier is used to select a 16-bit
or 32-bit instruction encoding.

`.N`: Narrow: Assembler must select a 16-bit instruction.

`.W`: Wide: Assembler must select a 32-bit instruction.

If the instruction is not available in the requested encoding the
assembler produces an error.

If no qualifier is given the assembler selects the 16-bit encoding if it
is available.

In the instruction examples `<q>` is used to indicate that `.N` or `.W` can be used.

## Data Transfer Commands

### Move Data between Registers (`MOV`, `MVN`)

Moves a value (or it's negated value) from one register to an other.

Moving immediate value directly into a register is also possible.

There are also command for moving shifted data. In this case
the `MOV` commands are aliases for the shifting commands.

#### Immediate

    :::nasm
    MOVS <Rd>,#<imm8>     /* Outside IT block */
    MOV<c> <Rd>,#<imm8>   /* Inside IT block */
    MOV{S}<c>.W <Rd>,#<const>
    MOVW<c> <Rd>,#<imm16>

#### Register

    :::nasm
    MOV<c> <Rd>,<Rm>
    MOVS <Rd>,<Rm>
    MOV{S}<c>.W <Rd>,<Rm>

Examples:

    :::nasm
    MOV R3, R2; /* Move the value from R2 to R3 */
    MVN R5, R6; /* Move the negated value of R6 to R5 */

#### Move to top half-word of Register (`MOVT`)

Moves an immediate value to the top half of the given register. The
bottom half of the register is not written.

    :::nasm
    MOVT<c><q> <Rd>, #<imm16>


#### Move Special Register to Register (`MRS`)


    :::nasm
    MRS<c> <Rd>,<spec_reg>

`MRS` is a system level instruction except when accessing the *APSR* or *CONTROL* register.


#### Move Register to Special Register (`MSR`)

    :::nasm
    MSR<c> <spec_reg>,<Rn>

`MRS` is a system level instruction except when accessing the *APSR* or *CONTROL* register.

<!---### Move Data between Register and Memory

The basic commands for moving data to and from memory are store and load.
They exist with different operand sizes (byte, half word, word and double word).

With some commands a register operand can be updated after the operation with `!`. If it's
available it is optional.

There are commands for storing or loading multiple registers at once.

##  Branch Commands

- `B`: Branch (immediate)
- `BL`: Branch with link (immediate)
- `BX`: Branch indirect (register)
- `BLX`: Branch indirect with link (register)

All these branch to a label, or to an address given by the operand.

In addition:

- The `BL` and `BLX` instructions write the address of the next instruction to *LR*.
- The `BX` and `BLX` instructions can change the instruction set (ARM &harr; Thumb).


> The `BX` and `BLX` instructions result in a *UsageFault* exception on the M3 if bit[0] of the target address is 0.

`B` is the only conditional instruction that can be inside or outside an *IT* block.
All other branch instructions can only be conditional inside an *IT* block, and are always unconditional otherwise.


### Branch (`B`)

Branch to a target addressed.

    :::nasm
    B<c> <label>
    B<c>.W <label>
    B<c><q> <label>

### Branch with Link (`BL`)

Calls a function at PC-relative address.

    :::nasm
    BL<c><q> <label>

`<label>`: The label to jump to. The assembler calculates the offset
of the `BL` instruction and the label.


### Branch and Exchange (`BX`)

Calls a function at an address and instruction set (ARM/Thumb) specified in a register.

It's the same as `BXL` but it **doesn't save** the next instruction in *LR*.

> Be aware that the Cortex-M3 only supports Thumb! (see `BLX`)

    :::nasm
    BX<c> <Rm>   /* Outside or last in IT block */
    BX<c><q> <Rm>


Exceptions: UsageFault


### Branch with Link and Exchange (`BLX`)

Calls a function at an address and instruction set (ARM/Thumb) specified in a register.

It saves the next instruction (after `BLX`) in *LR*.

> Be aware that the Cortex-M3 only supports Thumb! An attempt to change to ARM Mode will
> cause an *UsageFault* exception.

    :::nasm
    BLX<c> <Rm>          /* Outside or last in IT block */
    BLX<c><q> <Rm>

Exceptions: UsageFault


## Compare and Branch Commands

### Compare and Branch on Non-Zero and Compare and Branch on Zero (`CBNZ`,`CBZ`)

Compares the value in register with zero, and conditionally branches *forward* a constant value.
The condition flags are not affected.

> these instructions are not allowed inside an *IT* block.

    :::nasm
    CB{N}Z <Rn>,<label>    /* Not permitted in IT block */
    CB{N}Z<q> <Rn>, <label>

`<Rn>`: Register must be in range *R0* - *R7*.

`<label>`: The assembler calculates the offset from the `CB{N}Z` instruction to the label.
Permitted offsets are even numbers in the range 0 to 126.



## Other Commands

### Calculate Address (`ADR`)

Calculate *PC* relative address.

Add immediate value to *PC* and store result in register.

    :::nasm
    ADR<c> <Rd>,<label>
    ADR<c>.W <Rd>,<label> /* <label> before current instruction */
    SUB <Rd>,PC,#0.       /* Special case for zero offset */
    ADR<c><q> <Rd>, <label>
    ADD<c><q> <Rd>, PC,  #<const>
    SUB<c><q> <Rd>, PC,  #<const> /* Special case */

### Break-point (`BKPT`)

Causes a *DebugMonitor* exception or a debug halt.

It is a unconditional instruction and can be executed inside or
outside an *TI* block.

    :::nasm
    BKPT<q>#<imm8>

`<imm8>` is a 8-bit value that is ignored by the hardware
but can be used to store some information by a debugger.

Exceptions: *DebugMonitor*

### Debug Hint (`DBG`)

Provides a hint to debug and trace systems.
The debug architecture defines the use (if any).

    :::nasm
    DBG<c><q>#<option>
    // Any decoding of 'option' is specified by the debug system
    
    
    
### No Operation (`NOP`)

The NOP does nothing.

    :::nasm
    NOP<c>
    NOP<c>.W
